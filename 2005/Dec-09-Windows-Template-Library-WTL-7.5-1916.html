<h1>Windows Template Library (WTL) 7.5</h1>
<P>It looks like my old friend Nenad Stefanovic is up to his old tricks with <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=48cb01d7-112e-46c2-bb6e-5bb2fe20e626">a new version of my favorite native framework, the Windows Template Library</A>. This will go nicely with ATL Internals, 2e, which Chris Tavares is finishing up for Brent and me.</P>
