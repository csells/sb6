<h1>I'm starting to speak in numbers</h1>
Someone posted an URL to a mailing list I'm on. My response to his post was "404." I bet you know what I meant w/o thinking about it. He knew and responded as if I'd written in English. This reminds me of the old joke about the guys that'd be around each other so long, they replaced back the same&nbsp;old jokes with numbers and make each other laugh. It's a funny old world.
