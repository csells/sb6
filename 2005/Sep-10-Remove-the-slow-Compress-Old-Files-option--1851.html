<h1>Remove the slow "Compress Old Files" option!</h1>
I love CleanMgr.exe's ability to clean out my temp folder, my internet cache and my recycle bin in one swell foop, but that damn "Compress Old Files" option drives me crazy! Luckily, <A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PowerUserWindowsRegistryTweaks.aspx">Scott Hanselman</A> got a .reg file from <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/savanness/">Shawn Van Ness</A> and now I don't have to put up with that option. Wahoo!
