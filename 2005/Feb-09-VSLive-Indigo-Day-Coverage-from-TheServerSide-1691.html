<h1>VSLive Indigo Day Coverage from TheServerSide</h1>
Paul Ballard provides <A href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=VSLiveDay02">a nice summary of the Indigo Day at VSLive</A>. I especially like the acronyms that the Indigo boys were using; the ABCs of Indigo&nbsp;and the CIA of security are damned easy to remember!
