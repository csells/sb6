<h1>I Think VSLive Is *It*</h1>
<P>It's become apparent to me that for Microsoft-focused non-Microsoft hosted conferences, <A href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/">VSLive is it</A>. I know that in the past that they've had financial problems, but I haven't heard rumors of that for a while. Even more importantly, their attendance numbers and their coverage is top notch for 3rd party Windows developer conferences. If I was going to speak at a wide-reach Windows developer conference that wasn't a TechEd or a PDC, VSLive would be it.</P>
