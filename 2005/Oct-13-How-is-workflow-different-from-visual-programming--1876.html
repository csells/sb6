<h1>How is "workflow" different from "visual programming?"</h1>
Is there something intrinsic about "workflow" that needs to be surfaced to folks or would any visual programming language do? I'm not finding any commercial products in my web searches, but I know that there have been some "integrated component"-style programming languages where you lay flow and logic out from a set of components on a toolbox. Is Windows Workflow Foundation one of those that MS just happens to be doing or is there something important about "workflow" that interests folks?
