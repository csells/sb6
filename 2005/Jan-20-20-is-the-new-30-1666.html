<h1>20 is the new 30</h1>
I find the idea of <A href="http://budgetingbabe.blogspot.com/2005/01/twixting.html">kids coming home from college to live with their parents again</A> with they start a career, save for a house and build a relationship to be interesting. I like my kids, so wouldn't mind this (although they're not teenagers yet, so who knows if I'll still like 'em? : ).
