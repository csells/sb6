<h1>Google Site Search *Is* Working!</h1>
Doh! It was all about the outer &lt;form runat="server"&gt; that I wasn't using on my web pages, but just left 'cuz "it wasn't hurting anything." Removing the outer form let the inner Google site search form work and wa la -- site searching on sellsbrothers.com (and it only took 10 years : ). Thanks to <a href="http://www.fastchicken.co.nz/blog">Nic Wise</a> for his diagnosis!
