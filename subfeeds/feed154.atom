&lt;p>Sorry it took so long to judge the entries, but I was overwhelmed. That'll 
teach me to host &lt;a href="/12646">an international, pan-galactic, cross-universe 
coding contest&lt;/a>. : )&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Grand Prize Winner and Best Developer Tool: 
&lt;a href="mailto:Stoyan.Damov@rila.com">Stoyan Damov&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Stoyan wins the grand prize of free admission to the
&lt;a href="/conference">Web Services DevCon&lt;/a>. His entry is shown here:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Stoyan%20screen%20shot.JPG" width="679" height="390">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>KbView allows the user to pick a technology or set of technologies that s/he 
is interested in and see what's new in that space. Once the articles are 
fetched, they're listed on the right hand side, where they can be shown directly 
in the text viewer below or they can be hosted in a separate IE window. Also, 
once the article has been downloaded, it's cached for quick access for next time. 
This is an app that I will use. Great work, Stoyan!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Best Rookie: &lt;a href="mailto:sorinj@softhome.net">Sorin Jianu&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Sorin wins a year 
subscription to MSDN Universal for his submission:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Sorin%20Jianu%20screen%20shot.JPG" width="471" height="430">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sorin's submission is a functional proxy server and represents his first .NET 
project ever. It's fully asychronous and uses non-blocking I/O. It's quite a 
testament to what can be done in .NET in a single day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Most Polished: &lt;a href="mailto:jeffb@onlinetoolworks.com">Jeff Braunstein&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Jeff wins a 12-month 
subscription (5 points) to Safari Tech Books Online for his entry:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Jeff%20Brawstein%20screen%20shot.JPG" width="547" height="359">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeff's entry was the most polished I got, both in the UI as shown above, but 
also in the documentation, which included a market justification. I can see Jeff 
selling a version of this tool soon. The UI above is a front end to an NT 
service, also written in .NET, that takes jobs off of an MSMQ queue for batch 
dispatch. Because of the flexible architecture, these jobs can be spawned on a 
single machine or across multiple machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Best VS.NET Add-In: &lt;a href="mailto:iioffe@bezeqint.net">Igal Ioffe&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Igal wins a 
signed box copy of Visual Studio .NET for his VS.NET add-in:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Igal%20Ioffe%20screenshot.JPG" width="561" height="300">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Igal's submission is simple, but effective. I often mail snippets of code 
around and now I can do it with the context menu from without VS.NET.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Best Consumption of XML: &lt;a href="mailto:dejan@jelovic.com">Dejan Jelovic&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Dejan won his pick of a combination of things, but I couldn't talk him into 
taking anything -- he just wanted to compete. His application is a fully 
functional RSS reader:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Dejan%20screenshot.JPG" width="676" height="379">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dejan's RSS reader has two tabs, one for the RSS feed administration itself, 
persisted between sessions, and one for the combination of the content for all 
of your feeds in a single web page, cached between sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Best Use of SQL: &lt;a href="mailto:simon.wilson@objectnation.com">Simon E.P. Wilson&lt;/a>, Markus Burri &amp;amp; Thomas Schwarz&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Simon, Markus and Thomas win a 10-user copy of rmTrack for their SQL Stored 
Procedure code generator:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/SPInvoke.jpg" width="756" height="579">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the settings are chosen, the generated code lets the user make calls 
into the stored procedure from their .NET language of choice almost as if the 
function was a native .NET method:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>class MyApp {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        // Create Connection
        SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(@&amp;quot;...");
        conn.Open();      

&lt;b>        // Invoke the Stored Procedure
        SalesByCategory.Result res = SalesByCategory.Invoke(conn, "Beverages", "");
&lt;/b>
        // Show Results
        foreach (SalesByCategory.Row row in res.Rows) {
            Console.WriteLine("{0} : {1}", row.ProductName, row.TotalPurchase);
        }&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>        conn.Close();
    }
}&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2>Honorable Mention&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There were so many other great entries that I couldn't narrow it to just the 
big prize winners. The following were each awarded their pick of a book or a 
free software package:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Best Use of XML, &lt;a href="mailto:AdamCogan@ssw.com.au">Adam Cogan&lt;/a>&lt;/b>: This entry was cool because it used a 
  smart client to gather information about a user's system, email to deliver it 
  and XML to make server-side processing a snap (&lt;a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Adam%20Cogan%203%20screenshot.JPG">screen 
  shot&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Best Web Service Client, &lt;a href="mailto:darrel@tavis.ca">Darrel Miller&lt;/a>&lt;/b>: I liked Darrel's 
  application because of the nice mix of a smart client front-end to capture all 
  settings to make a single, atomic web service call and the production of a web 
  site based on the  posted data (&lt;a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Darrel%20Miller%20screenshot.JPG">screen 
  shot 1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Darrel%20Miller%20screenshot%202.JPG">screen shot 2&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Best Technical Insight, &lt;a href="mailto:glombard@everdreamcorp.com">Gert Lombard&lt;/a>&lt;/b>: Gert's command line parser 
  was near and dear to me for two reasons. One, he'd built a command line parser 
  based on .NET's Reflection, &lt;a href="http://www.genghisgroup.com">just like 
  I've done&lt;/a> in Genghis with the CommandLineParser class, and two, he built it because he fell in love with Reflection, 
  just like I did (&lt;a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Gert%20screen%20shot.JPG">screen shot&lt;/a>,
  &lt;a href="http://codeblast.com/~gert/dotnet/sells.html">source&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Best Game Library, &lt;a href="mailto:richard@caetano.com">Richard Caetano&lt;/a>&lt;/b>: Richard's entry wasn't quite 
  complete, but I love Poker as much as I love .NET, so I thought I'd point out 
  that he's provided a complete managed card drawing library, in case anyone 
  needs one (&lt;a href="http://www.stronglytyped.com/npoker/">screen 
  shot and source&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Best Entry From High School Student, &lt;a href="mailto:rd933@msn.com">Ryan Dawson&lt;/a>&lt;/b>: I'm not sure I 
  should be encouraging such behavior, but I certainly spent my fair share alone 
  in my parent's basement with my computer and I turned out all right (didn't 
  I?!?), so I thought I'd mention that Ryan was the only high school student 
  (that I know of) that submitted an entry. Also, he used
  &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnforms/html/winforms08162002.asp">
  my pi calculator&lt;/a> to calculate 20K digits of pi for extra credit, so 
  clearly things are working out for him. Remember to cite your sources, Ryan! : 
  )&lt;/li>
