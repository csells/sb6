From Jeff Richard: Hello:

I am in the process of constructing an application using Microsoft's smart client architecture (no-touch deployment), leveraging dynamic assembly loading to prevent installation on the client PC.  I have run into a situation where I need a browser control to display content from an existing web site (help, reports).  The problem is that the IE COM control cannot be consumed from a smart client application due to a security violation.  I found a workaround, not he best solution since the path to IEXPLORE.EXE must be known, using the Win32 CreateProcess() API call to launch an instance of IE in a separate process.  Security is handled by granting the application the ability to execute unmanaged assemblies.

Has anyone found a "pure" .NET browser control that supports similar rendering capabilities as the IE COM control?

Jeff.
