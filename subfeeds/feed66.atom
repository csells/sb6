    <title>DonXML Updates His SVG2XAML Tool For WinHEC LH</title>

    <summary>DonXML has ported his SVG to XAML conversion tool to the WinHEC build of Longhorn and provides the source as well as the binary on his GotDotNet workspace. Eventually, we'll be awash in real tools that output XAML, but until then conversion tools are important so that real artists can use the tools with which they're already familiar, output them into a vector format supported by that tool and then convert them to XAML for use in Longhorn apps. </summary>
