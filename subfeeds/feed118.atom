&lt;p>
I've long lamented that I have no clue what the basics of marketing are and 
therefore I've been at the mercy of actual marketing people whose skill I can't 
judge. In fact, I so miss this important knowledge in my life that &lt;a href="/12392">
I interviewed for a marketing job at Microsoft&lt;/a> (although I was in no danger 
of getting it). A *long* time friend of mine, Dave Stroble, said that I was too 
&amp;quot;customer-focused&amp;quot; to be in marketing, anyway, and I should be glad I'm not in 
that field. When I asked how that could be (isn't customer focus the core of 
marketing?), he went on to say the following:&lt;/p>&lt;blockquote>&amp;quot;Marketing is not 
	about giving the customer what he wants, or even finding out what the 
	customer wants and trying to get engineering to create it. It's about trying 
	to sell the customer what you already have -- whether that's product, 
	talent, or pre-conceived notions. If the needs of a customer occasionally 
	overlap with an actual product, that's merely random coincidence.&lt;/p>&lt;p>
	&amp;quot;Marketing people are customer-focused in the sense of always thinking about 
	why customers aren't buying enough stuff, and how to get them to buy more. 
	You're customer-focused in the sense of caring about what customers need, 
	and helping them accomplish it, even if that doesn't result in selling 
	anything.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&amp;quot;But don't take it so hard. It's not as if I said you were 
	too honest to be a banker, or too smart to be a teacher. (God, what if girls 
	thought you were too handsome to be sexy?)&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>While I find this 
cleverly stated (even though I'm nowhere near too sexy for girls : ), I sure 
hope this isn't the real goal of marketing. My hope is that it's about taking a 
solution and letting folks that have the matching problem know so that you can 
trade your solution for their money and both consider yourselves lucky. Is this 
a naive view? Anyone with real marketing training want to chime in on the real 
goals of marketing?&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/diamond.html">Here&lt;/a>. Technology is wonderful for eliminating the inefficiencies in a market. In the '20s, there were "bucket shops" that operated on old stock information as gambling halls for delayed, off-street trading. By the '80s that was all computerized for pros only. In the '90s, the Internet took that all away, making it much harder to trade on the inefficiencies in the market for the pro, while enabling real-time trading for the average Joe.

Technology has ravaged many an industry, providing cars instead of carriages, MP3s instead of albums, MPEGs instead of movies (this is just starting) and now fake diamonds instead of real diamonds. The goal is always the same: bring the convenience to more people, cheaper, which means eliminating the inefficiencies, in this case the diamond cartels, out of the market.

My vote for a market ripe for such treatment is real estate. Why I'm penalized 3% of the sale price of my house for data entry into MLS, the national real estate database, and checking the paperwork (something I could get done by a real estate attorney for a few hundred dollars) is beyond me. I need my house entered into MLS if I'm going to make it known by buyer's agents and I need to keep paying them 3% or they won't bring their customers to see my house, but the 3% I pay to my seller's agent is just a waste. Can some please ravage real estate for me? Thanks. : )</content>

&lt;p>Robert Scoble (&lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011">the 
Scobleizer&lt;/a>) sent along his answer to a common question: What is it like to 
interview at Microsoft?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>About dress code while interviewing at Microsoft. Yeah, I wore a suit and 
tie. Not mandatory (no one wears them up here) but I feel it still shows respect 
for the company hiring you, and for the interviewing process. And, it makes it 
so I never wonder if I under dress. Microsoft employees might joke with you 
about being overdressed, though. That's cool. I'd rather that then have someone 
write me off cause I didn't dress well enough. But then, I was also up for a job 
that required me to be in front of people, so I'd expect to wear a suit and tie 
on the job occasionally.&lt;p>The process for me was:&lt;/p>
	&lt;ol>
		&lt;li>An exec asked me &amp;quot;would you ever consider working here?&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>A one-hour phone interview with HR. They asked me questions to make sure my 
experience matched my resume, and also to make sure I wasn't gonna embarrass 
them in the longer interviews.&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>I passed the HR interview, so they flew me up to Redmond.&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>My interviews started at 8:30 a.m. First interview was with someone else from 
HR. She explained the process, and asked a few more questions to ensure I was gonna be worth sending onto the first group.&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>She gave me a list of three candidates, which would take me through lunch. 
She was pretty clear that if the three liked me, I'd get another list of &amp;quot;after 
lunch&amp;quot; candidates.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ol>
Each interviewer would meet me at the lobby (Microsoft has a recruiter shuttle 
that'll fly you around). I'd usually try to get a question in, like &amp;quot;what role 
do you play here?&amp;quot; Just to get things going.&lt;p>The kinds of questions you'll get will vary, but I got a lot of questions about 
past experience, and some more fun ones &amp;quot;how would you get Google to convert 
from Linux to Windows?&amp;quot; Other people have gotten questions like &amp;quot;how would you 
sell ice to eskimos?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;how would you sell a pen to someone?&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
If you're up for a programmer job, they'll ask you logic questions, and ask you 
to demonstrate that you can think in code on the whiteboard.&lt;p>One guy asked me to explain the architecture of Radio UserLand on the 
whiteboard.&lt;/p>
There's an excellent book written on the Microsoft interviewing process called 
&amp;quot;Moving Mount Fuji.&amp;quot;&lt;p>I also read Chris Sells' &amp;quot;Interviewing at Microsoft&amp;quot; site: 
	&lt;a href="/tagged/interview">https://csells.github.io/sb6/fun/msiview/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
Some more advice: I came an hour early and took an early-moring walk around the 
campus. That helped me calm my mind down, and get into what it's like being 
there. Also, it let me think about &amp;quot;why do I want to work at Microsoft?&amp;quot; which 
was one of my first interview questions.&lt;p>I brought my own water bottle. That saved awkward moments where interviewers 
would want to take you to the company refrigerators. It also makes it look like 
you aren't there to take advantage of Microsoft's largess. Try not to drink too 
much during the day. The temptation is to drink a Diet Coke on every interview. 
You can get a bit jittery by the end of the day.&lt;/p>
I also treated everyone I met as an interview candidate. I have no idea if the 
recruiting shuttle drivers report back on their feedback or not, but why take 
the chance? Plus, the stories you hear are often good ones to tell later on.&lt;p>They did interview 
	me over lunch, by the way, and also took me to a Sonics' game 
. I'm sure that was to get a feel for how I'd be in social situations. Behave, 
and geek out! (we only watched about five minutes of the Sonics' game cause we 
were so busy talking tech).&lt;/p>
I later found out that they usually have three to seven candidates fly up for 
each job and that flying up isn't any guarantee of a job. A few friends have 
gotten flown up and didn't pass muster.&lt;p>My wife has interviewed here too and didn't get hired. I think it's solely on 
passion. Most of the people who work here are hard-core geeks and they like 
hiring other geeks. Anything you can say to demonstrate that you're a geek and 
that you love playing with technology is probably a good thing.&lt;/p>
Later I found out that the flyup interview is mostly to see if the candidate can 
fit into both the job, and work with the team. They figure you're mostly 
qualified because you got that far. They're just trying to make sure you'll fit 
in at that point.&lt;p>Don Box also gave me some advice: &amp;quot;we want you to think, so think.&amp;quot; The way 
another friend of mine put it, is &amp;quot;look like you think about every answer. Take 
a few seconds to think about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
My answer to the Google question? &amp;quot;Acquire them.&amp;quot; Hey, it worked for Hotmail. 
(Seriously, then I followed that smartass answer up with a more serious one ) . 
Luckily I had spent a few hours with some of the kids who started Hotmail, so I 
knew what the pain points were in getting them to move their system from FreeBSD 
to Windows.&lt;p>When did I know I had the job? At about 6 p.m., the guy who invited 
	me up, told 
	me I had gotten a job. Turned out I wasn't appropriate for the job I was 
interviewing for (which he knew) and then he made a new job. It took a couple of 
weeks to get all the T-s crossed from that point. Other people don't learn 
whether or not the got the job for a week or two afterward. It's OK to ask at 
the end.&lt;/p>
If you get walked to the door at lunch, though, you know you blew it somewhere. 
(Not many get walked to the door, from what the recruiting shuttle drivers tell 
	me).&lt;p>One last piece of advice: keep your energy up all day long. It's tough. Hard to 
think straight at 4 p.m. after answering questions all day long. But, a lot of 
the decisions are made on &amp;quot;does this guy get excited by technology?&amp;quot; 
	&lt;/p>
Good luck in your interviews! 
	&lt;p>--Robert&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a 
few weeks at Microsoft, when I was feeling particularly frazzled with my work 
and travel schedule, Peter Drayton pulled me aside to reinforce what I'd heard 
before: the first 6 months at MS suck for everyone; after that, you either hate 
it forever or you can't ever imagine working anywhere else. At that point in my 
budding MS career, I was leaning towards the former. Peter, having been there, 
said that he'd gotten a piece of advice that had seen him through.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The 
advice was simple: have an agenda. The idea is, no matter what projects you work 
on, no matter what groups you go to, no matter what tasks you're into that day, 
to have an underlying agenda that pushes you forward and drives your decisions. 
Businesses call such a thing a &amp;quot;vision statement.&amp;quot; Authors call it a &amp;quot;story.&amp;quot; 
Whatever you call it, it's always helpful to have one and here's mine:&lt;/p>&lt;blockquote>
	&amp;quot;Remember what it's like to not work at Microsoft.&amp;quot; &lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>That's 
it. That's my goal. Of course, as with all things, Dr. Seuss says it better than 
I can:&lt;/p>&lt;blockquote>&amp;quot;I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the 
	trees, for the trees have no tongues.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote>I consider it my mission 
to speak for the thousands of developers that I've known and talked to over the 
years that have no tongue inside Microsoft.&lt;p>This came up just this morning on 
the phone with a colleague of mine at MS. He said, &amp;quot;We need to maintain the 
value of X.&amp;quot; I replied, &amp;quot;I don't care about the value of X. I care about 
enabling our customers to get the most out of our products.&amp;quot; Of course, there 
are hundreds of people concerned with X inside of MS and they would be less than 
happy that I'd dismissed the value of it, but that didn't matter to me. What 
mattered was being the kind of developer advocate inside of MS that had helped 
me when I wasn't there and to be a constant reminder to my colleagues of the 
needs of those folks.&lt;/p>Since MS was founded by developers and run by 
developers (which has its pros and cons), I plan on being more successful than 
the Lorax.
