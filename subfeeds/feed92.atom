&lt;P>While &lt;A href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/3423.aspx">Rory's virtual pet sidebar tile sample&lt;/A> isn't especially useful for a corporate desktop (although maybe a "virtual employee" version could be used to screen potential managers before they're inflicted on unsuspecting "real" employees... : ), it does show off the intended usage for the sidebar: stuff that you absolutely, positively have to look at all day long.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>As an example of what I mean, consider a typical example: the weather tile. Do you really need to know what the weather is all day long? Do you need to know it enough to take up valuable screen real estate to show it to you? I know I don't.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>But, do you need to see a virtual pet all day long? You do if it's important enough to want to run it and keep it happy. Do you want to remember to flip to it all day long as an app running in the background? Nope. And that's why it's a perfect tile sample. If you run it at all, it's important enough to take up screen real estate all day long.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>You can read about these and other interesting sidebar guidelines in &lt;A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/ux/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnaero/html/wux_topic_sidebar.asp">the sidebar section&lt;/A> of &lt;A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/ux/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnaero/html/samplerintro.asp">the Longhorn User Experience guide&lt;/A> (still under construction, of course).

&lt;P>I've always loved writers that start with something I'm familiar, in this case, a star defined in a hunk of XAML, and then build it up to add new features, in this case color, opacity, scale and rotation animations. The reason I love this style is that if I'm at a computer, I can follow along, folding the new features into my code and learning how things work by doing it. Or, if I'm reading the piece in the bathtub (which happens surprisingly often), I can build the code in my head (at least, 'til I get one of those cool waterproof military laptops).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Kenny's piece almost does that, but the initial showing of the &amp;lt;TransformCollection&amp;gt; is shown without context, so it's hard to know where it goes in the growing piece of XAML I was working on. Still, he follows it up a few sentences later with the entire XAML sample, so I can see the context. If he'd have been a little more explicit about the details of the animations he was applying and had wrapped it up with a summary, it would've been nearly perfect.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Oh, and animations in Avalon are cool, too. : )&lt;/P></content>
