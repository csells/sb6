    (my father always said that &amp;quot;laziness is the mother of invention&amp;quot;),
    &lt;a href="/public/tools/imcli.zip">I built a couple of C# classes for managing an IM

    It does the MD5 stuff properly and handles being redirected to another IM 
    server, so the hard part of the protocol is already implemented. The sample 
    itself is a handy little program that logs in as an IM user, sends a message 
    to another IM user and logs back off again. Perfect for annoying your office

        Peter Drayton has also written up a summary&lt;/a> (which is much more 
        technically meaty), as well as a commentary. There has been some quite 
        spiriting follow up on this talk all over the Internet:

        &lt;a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/03/06/deviant.html">
        XML Deviant on XML.COM&lt;/a>. Also, while I absolutely agree with Don 
        that the way we use HTTP today leads to trouble, I thought that Ian 
        Griffiths, a fellow DevelopMentor instructor, had a wonderful point of 
        view that he allowed me to share:&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>&lt;i>Guest opinion by Ian Griffiths&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Basically Don seemed to be saying that there are two problems with 
        HTTP (and saying HTTP is dead is just an effective way of getting people 
        to listen; I was half tempted to start my Windows Forms speech at the UK 
        MSDN DevCon with &amp;quot;The Web Application is Dead&amp;quot;). &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>One of these is that HTTP is unidirectional. Surely .NET remoting 
        shows that this isn't strictly true: individual connections are 
        directional but it's entirely possible to do callbacks by having 
        connections go in both directions. (Well duh.) The real problem is that 
        the firewall architectures of the internet are designed to make sure the 
        connections only go in one direction; it's not a problem with the 
        protocol per se, it's a problem with the infrastructure. In order to fix 
        this problem you need to change the infrastructure regardless of what 
        you do to the protocol. And if you fix the infrastructure you don't 
        actually need to fix the protocol, since we already know that it's fine 
        on networks that don't deliberately break bidirectional communication.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Arguably one of the main obstacles here is the use of NAT - NAT makes 
        it hard for a client behind a firewall to publish an endpoint. But NAT 
        is fundamentally important because we'd have run out of IP addresses 
        already if it weren't in such widespread use. So the only way to get rid 
        of NAT is for everyone to upgrade to IPv6. This will presumably happen 
        fairly soon since we will run out of IP addresses in any case in about 3 
        or 4 years. (Windows XP ships with IPv6 support by the way. Type &amp;quot;ipv6 
        install&amp;quot; at a command prompt if you haven't already. So Microsoft are 
        quietly making IPv6 ubiquitous on the desktop.) &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>So presuming ipv6 takes off, that's a fundamental technical obstacle 
        to the one-way nature of HTTP removed. But another one remains: just 
        because IPv6 pushes the address exhaustion date out of our lifetimes (we 
        hope), doesn't mean that firewall admins will let connections work both 
        ways through the firewall. The bidirectional problem can only be solved 
        with the blessing of firewall admins. And once you have that you don't 
        actually need IPv6, strictly speaking - given a suitable protocol 
        between the client machines and the firewall there's no reason that NAT 
        can't be done in both directions. (Indeed my sub-$100 firewall appliance 
        can do this on a statically configured basis. It is possible (if a 
        little inconvenient) for machines behind the firewall to publish 
        endpoints successfully.) &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>UPnP apparently has a solution for this. (A better one than static 
        configuration.) It supports P2P network applications that require 
        clients behind the firewall to be able to accept incoming connections. 
        It defines precisely what you need: a protocol that lets a client 
        machine negotiate with the firewall to open up a port for incoming 
        connections. So it turns out that a technical solution to the problem 
        already exists. (Without even having to invoke IPv6. Although we still 
        need that, due to a shortage of address bits in IPv4.)&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>So the first problem already has a technical solution. Presume for a 
        moment (and it's a big presumption) that these solutions can be 
        deployed, and firewall admin policies set up so that they are broadly 
        useable. &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>At this point, the second complaint Don makes - the fact that 
        long-running requests don't sit well with HTTP - becomes much less of an 
        issue. We just need to use separate HTTP requests for the request and 
        the response. We connect to the server, send a request, along with some 
        response endpoint info (a URL). When the server is done it connects to 
        us, sends us a response. And we're done. I'm guessing it would probably 
        be possible to write a .NET remoting channel that works like this. The 
        only obstacle is the ability for clients to advertise endpoints.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>So if a client can advertise an endpoint somehow (i.e. it can (a) 
        convince the firewall to let a connection request come in, and (b) work 
        out what the endpoint should be - it needs to be aware of any NAT 
        translation going on) then HTTP can actually solve both the problems 
        raised here. And as far as I can tell, *any* solution to the problems 
        raised is going to have to allow the client to receive incoming 
        requests. In which case why invent a new protocol? Once you've solved 
        the fundamental problems in the network that stop you from doing this, 
        HTTP is good enough.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>The only issues are: (1) getting everyone to agree on how clients 
        will expose endpoints (UPnP has had nothing but bad press so far, since 
        the only thing most people know about it is that the first security hole 
        discovered in Windows XP was connected to it somehow; so it might have 
        to be something else...), and (2) convincing firewall admins to allow 
        this functionality to be used.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Of course just because a technical solution exists doesn't mean it's 
        a great solution. Given that this is a fair distance from HTTP as 
        originally envisaged, it would doubtless be possible to design a 
        protocol better suited to the job. But would the benefits be worth it? 
        Everyone already has an HTTP stack and an XML parser - will they flock 
        to implement a new purpose-built solution?&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>The problems raised in the ZDnet article can essentially be summed up 
        thus: clients can't expose endpoints. To me, this doesn't look like a 
        problem with HTTP, it's a problem with the infrastructure. Changing the 
        protocol is certainly not sufficient to fix the infrastructure problems; 
        it's not clear to me that it is even necessary. &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>So really this is a social problem, not a technical one. ;-)&lt;/p>

        &lt;p>As .NET demands new books and articles and the economy has given a 
        lot of smart folk free time, the world is becoming inundated in .NET 
        books, articles, talks and courses, many of which I am tapped to review. 
        Some are wonderful. Some are awful. Most, however are *almost* good, the 
        path to goodness well within the author's reach but for the answer to one 
        question: &amp;quot;why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Most of my feedback is riddled with questions that start with why: 
        &amp;quot;Why was it built this way?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Why are there three choices and how do I 
        choose?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Why should I care?&amp;quot; Please, when you write, remember this 
        question and answer it thoroughly and well. The why is *so* much more 
        important than the how. The online documentation for .NET is fabulous 
        for describing the how, once you understand the motivation for this 
        class, that method or the other namespace.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Prose that provides the how is transient, but prose that provides the 
        why becomes classic because the why itself is surprisingly applicable 
        between technologies. At the very least, if you answer the why, it will 
        save me work if I'm to review your prose.&lt;/p>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1>How Did You Get Your Start?&lt;/h1>

        &lt;p>&lt;i>Standing in the rain, with his head hung low, couldn't get a 
        ticket, it was a sold out show, heard the roar of the crowd, he could 
        picture the scene, put his ear to the wall and like a distant scream, he 
        heard one guitar, just blew him away, saw stars in his eyes and the very 
        next day, bought a beat-up six string in a second hand store, didn't 
        know how to play it, but he knew for sure that one guitar felt good in 
        his hands, didn't take long to understand, just one guitar, slunk way 
        down low, was a one-way ticket, only one way to go, so he started 
        rocking, ain't never gonna stop, gotta keep on rockin', someday gonna 
        make it to the top and be a Jukebox Hero....&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>&lt;i>Jukebox Hero, Foreigner&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>It's my understanding that once a musician reaches a certain level of 
        notoriety, they are often asked how they got their start, so that the 
        fan can obtain the level of success that the musician has obtained. Over 
        the years, I've received quite a few of these kinds of emails, all of 
        which flatter and surprise me, since I don't feel like I've obtained the 
        level of success that I'd like to. Still, I'm happy to offer, if not advice, 
        than  a list of what I did to obtain a level of recognition in our 
        little circle.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>It all started in early 1994, when I went to work for DevelopMentor. 
        Don's strategy, which remains in place to this day, was to give every 
        instructor the opportunity for &amp;quot;stardom.&amp;quot; He had just started to obtain 
        his own notoriety in the industry with his flamboyant personality, 
        teaching and answering every other question on the DCOM mailing list. 
        From there, he used his political acumen to make friends with conference 
        organizers and book publishers, working to add the same level of rigor 
        to Windows development as he was accustomed to applying in the pursuit 
        of his PhD.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Since Don is a fellow that gains happiness in togetherness (or, put 
        another way, &amp;quot;misery loves company&amp;quot;), he dragged the rest of us into his 
        world of course authorship, 24x7 mailing lists, speaker anxiety, article 
        deadlines and demanding book editors. To find my place in this world, I 
        did the following, leveraging the success I had in the early work to 
        make the later work happen:&lt;/p>
        &lt;ul>
          &lt;li>Answered every other question on the DCOM and ATL mailing lists 
          and continue to be very active on the .NET mailing list.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Wrote and gave numerous courses and conference talks.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Wrote a number of books and articles.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Put up a web site dedicated, initially, to the various bits and 
          pieces of code I'd built and then expanded it as I had more to say 
          (which turned out to be quite a lot, apparently : ).&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Took as much consulting as I could to gain real-world experience, 
          which I put into my other work.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Asked fans and happy clients to post their comments on Amazon or 
          allow me to post to my own web site.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Crazy things just for fun, e.g. pose naked or misinterpret an 
          email on purpose in order to post a humorous response.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Made friends with the owners and producers of the technology in 
          which I was interested.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Threw a couple of conferences.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Started (and stopped) a department to build software developer 
          tools.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Launched my own (budding) software development tools.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Launched a couple of source available projects with folks from the 
          community.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Launched my own mailing list.&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;p>It seems like a lot, but practically everything I've done since 1994 
        has been published with my name on it, making me as much an agent for 
        myself as an actual &amp;quot;musician&amp;quot; (I believe the phrase is &amp;quot;shameless 
        self-promotion&amp;quot; : ). Based on this experience, here are the guiding 
        principles that I try to follow:&lt;/p>
        &lt;ul>
          &lt;li>Do the right thing. My father always used to say that anything 
          worth doing was worth doing right and that the right thing was easy to 
          spot -- its was the hardest.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>You can't win if you don't bet.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Be very thorough so that I can be sure of myself, leading to...&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Take a stand. Have an opinion. Defend my opinion until I have been 
          convinced of my mistake, then admit my mistake and take up the 
          opposite stand with equal vigor.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Try a lot of things and don't be afraid to make mistakes.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Be quick to give credit and admit mistakes, both in public and in 
          private.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Recognize opportunity and follow up.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Get down to the real &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; of something, whether it's computer 
          technology or another kind of technical discipline.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Recognize the people, on the other hand, don't always have a 
          &amp;quot;why,&amp;quot; and learn to deal with it (I still work on that!).&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Always strive for quality over the quick and dirty.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Concentrate on the things that I really want to do. I like to say 
          &amp;quot;Only do those things that you can't *not* do,&amp;quot; but in a down economy, 
          I've learned to temper that with fiscal reality.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Finish what I start.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Make sure people are happy with my work and don't stop 'til they 
          are.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Have balance in my life. I have a wife and children that I love 
          and spend as much time with as possible.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Horse trade. I am always willing to offer what I have, e.g. 
          experience, time, contacts, etc, for what I want, e.g. work, money, 
          content, etc.&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>Help other people find their own places. I'm constantly concerned 
          with my friends and their happiness and will do whatever I can to help 
          them get to do whatever it is that they &amp;quot;can't not do.&amp;quot; This is a 
          lesson I learned from Don. He helped me to become all that I could be 
          and, in turn, I do my best to help others.&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;p>Actually, most of this I learned from Don, either directly or 
        indirectly. I guess my only real piece of advise is to try to find 
        someone you admire and to do what they do. Don was my main mentor, but 
        I've had many over the years and they're invaluable, even if all I had 
        was a beat-up six string...&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;i>Chris Sells, &lt;span class="created">2/19/2002&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/p>&lt;p>I woke up this morning with a splitting headache. Just before I woke, I was dreaming that I was interviewing at Microsoft. They held nothing back. It was a group affair with several role-playing scenarios to see how I would handle them. At the end, they threw a mock wedding and sat Tate Donovan (Joshua from the Friends TV show) right next to 
me while he pretended to be a loud, drunk uncle. I ended up dragging him outside into the street and when he pulled a knife (he was also a Vietnam vet, apparently). I was able to get in one good shot before he &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot; 
me. Later I attempted to save face by explaining to Tate that I would've done better, but I was afraid to hurt him. Tate looked at 
me as if to say, &amp;quot;At Microsoft, we don't hold back.&amp;quot; Tough interview.&lt;/p></content>

I've been working at Microsoft for almost 5 years. I&amp;nbsp;have a wife&amp;nbsp;and twin 7-year-olds. I have an active church life. I work around 40-45&amp;nbsp;hours per week, and have for the whole time. I have a GREAT time at&amp;nbsp;Microsoft.&amp;nbsp;I'm a veteran of Silicon Valley. Been creating mostly systems software&amp;nbsp;since 1977. Microsoft is no different from most Silicon Valley&amp;nbsp;companies --better hours than most startups, more driven than HP. I do work an&amp;nbsp;occasional 50-55 hour week close to ship time. &lt;/p>&lt;p>&amp;quot;Now, there are people that work here with completely different stories. But&amp;nbsp;I am in no wise unique. I have lots of friends in basically the same&amp;nbsp;position -- 40 hour weeks.&amp;quot; &lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>Thanks for the quote, Mike.

    <content type="html">&lt;h1>Welcome to Genghis!&lt;/h1>
		&lt;h2>&lt;img border="0" src="/public/tools/genghis/images/genghis.gif" align="left" width="140" height="231">Welcome 
			to Genghis&lt;/h2>
		&lt;p>Genghis is a set of extensions built on top of .NET and integrated with WinForms 
			to provide application-level services in the same flavor as the Microsoft 
			Foundation Classes. Genghis gets its name as the functional heir to &lt;a href="/12652">
				Attila&lt;/a>, a similar set of functionality built on top of ATL.&lt;/p>
		&lt;h2>Disclaimer
		&lt;/h2>
		&lt;p>Most of the Genghis classes were built by different folks and while every effort 
			was made to keep things consistent by choosing .NET and WinForms design 
			techniques, everyone does things their own way.&lt;/p>
		&lt;p>This work is the work of the individuals involved and does not represent any 
			contribution of their respective employers. You are under no obligation to use 
			any of Genghis at any time, but if you do, &lt;a href="#license">you are required to 
				abide by the License&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
		&lt;h2>Installation&lt;/h2>
		&lt;p>You can
		&lt;a href="http://codeplex.com/genghis/">download the latest Genghis source code from here&lt;/a>. The Genghis 
		archive includes this page, the source code to the Genghis class 
		library, a series of samples showing off the various classes and a 
		pre-built, signed version of genghis.dll in the redist folder. Notice 
		that some of the samples use the Genghis files directly instead of using 
		the compiled Genghis assembly. Either usage is supported by Genghis 
		(except where it drives the WinForms Designer nuts).&lt;/p>
		&lt;h2>Source Code Control&lt;/h2>
		&lt;P>Genghis source code control has been moved to
		&lt;a href="http://codeplex.com/genghis/">
		the Genghis CodePlex workspace&lt;/a>. Thanks to
		GotDotNet and
		&lt;a href="mailto:rmacfadyen@rmtrack.com">Rob MacFadyen&lt;/a> for hosting 
		the previous versions.&lt;/P>
		&lt;h2>Building Genghis&lt;/h2>
      &lt;p>
         Genghis is written in C#. Building Genghis requires Visual C# or
         Visual Studio.NET.
         Visual Studio.NET solution and project files (*.sln and *.csproj)
         are provided to build Genghis and all the samples. You should be able
         to load any solution file into Visual C#/Visual Studio.NET and build
         the project for yourself.&lt;/p>
      &lt;p>
         A NAnt build script (Genghis.build) is also provided. It is used to 
			make the snapshot for Genghis, and is not designed for general use. 
			You may wish to use this file to simulate the snapshot build 
			process; please be aware that you will not be able to properly sign 
			the release mode Genghis DLL (the private key is not provided in 
			this distribution).
      &lt;/p>
      &lt;p>
         For Visual Studio.NET related build issues, please contact the
         &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic">Off Topic
         Windows mailing list&lt;/a>. This is where the Genghis contributors have
         their discussions, and most of them will be familiar with Visual
         Studio.NET builds of Genghis.
         If you have NAnt related build issues, you should contact
         &lt;a href="mailto:MplsCpl@yahoo.com">Mike Marshall&lt;/a> (the
         Genghis build master) directly.&lt;/p>Thanks to &lt;a href="http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com">
				Brad Wilson&lt;/a> for the NAnt build scripts for folks without VS.NET.&lt;h2>Bug Reports&lt;/h2>
		&lt;P>Bugs will now be kept in
		&lt;a href="http://codeplex.com/genghis/">
		the Bug Tracker section of the GDN Workspace&lt;/a>.&lt;/P>
		&lt;p>Please do not send Chris Sells or any of the other contributors personal email 
			complaining about Genghis. Also please do not post Genghis bug reports to any 
			mailing list. A much better way to contribute to the life of Genghis is to 
			submit the fix along with the bug report.&lt;/p>
		&lt;h2>Submission Guidelines&lt;/h2>
		&lt;ul>
			&lt;li>
			Submissions should be in the Genghis namespace (I don't think we'll have to 
			worry about collisions... : ).&lt;li>Submissions should be single-file and 
			stand-alone as much as possible. The goal is that Genghis can be built as a DLL 
			and used as a whole or that bits of its source can be pulled into individual 
			projects as needed ala atl.dll vs. atlwin.h.&lt;li>All code should be commenting 
			using C# doc comments so that docs can be generated via Tools-&amp;gt;Generate 
			Source Comments.&lt;li>All source code files should include &lt;a href="#license">the 
					copyright and license notice&lt;/a>.&lt;li>All code shall be set to use 
			spaces, not tabs, and a vanilla coding style.&lt;li>When hacking on existing code, 
				thou shall conform to the existing coding standard of the file. Many coding 
				standards are readable, but not when mixed.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>
		&lt;h2>The Genghis Group&lt;/h2>

			contributors:&lt;/p>

		&lt;p class="MsoNormal">Note: Anything marked with "&lt;font color="#008000">sample&lt;/font>" 
			means that there's a sample included with Genghis that shows the current

			official Genghis component. Mostly the hold-up is integration with the WinForms 
			Designer.&lt;/p>
		&lt;h2>Documentation&lt;/h2>
		&lt;p>The Genghis documentation is composed of the C# documentation comments as part 
			of the automated build. Check redist\Genghis.chm for the latest.&lt;/p>
		&lt;h2>SimplePad&lt;/h2>
		&lt;p>&lt;a href="/public/tools/genghis/MfcSimplePad.zip">SimplePad is 
				an MFC application&lt;/a> that should serve as a simple baseline for what 
			Genghis should enable to be built easily. We currently need a raw WinForms 
			implementation to help guide the Genghis development efforts. After building 
			it, use Help-&amp;gt;Help Topics to see the list of features that the MFC SimplePad 
			application provides straight out of the wizard (also duplicated here):&lt;/p>
		&lt;ul>
			&lt;li>
			MDI application&lt;li>Multiple documents&lt;li>Multiple views per document that are 
			updated as the document changes&lt;li>"Dirty" bit handling&lt;li>Title bar that shows 
			the document with the current focus along with a dirty indicator, i.e. the 
			asterix.&lt;li>File New, Open, Save, Save As, Exit and MRU&lt;li>MDI Window menu&lt;li>Separate 
			icons for the application and the documents&lt;li>Association of the icons with 
			the documents in the shell&lt;li>Dockable, floating toolbar&lt;li>Print, Print 
			Preview, Print Setup&lt;li>Edit Undo, Cut, Copy and Paste.&lt;li>View Toolbar and 
			Status bar&lt;li>Help Topics and About&lt;li>Context-sensitive help&lt;li>Status bar 
			that updates when menu items or toolbar items are in "focus", as well as 
			showing NUM, SCROLL and CAPS as these keys change. Since Microsoft has shown 
			that no one looks at the status bar much, the auto-update as items come into 
			focus is not a feature that needs to be duplicated in WinForms/Genghis.&lt;li>Command 
			line launching of the application based on the application's file extension&lt;li>Drag-n-drop 
			from the file explorer&lt;li>Double-click support from the file explorer (including 
				routing open requests to a currently open application)&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>

&lt;span class="created">2/16/2002&lt;/span>
        The following are actual questions from actual interviews conducted by 
        Microsoft employees on the main campus. Microsoft Consultants are sometimes 
        allowed to have a life, so questions asked of them during interviews don't 
        really count and aren't listed. &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>
            The questions tend to follow some basic themes:
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;ul>

        &lt;/h2>
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Why is a manhole cover round?
            &lt;/li>

            &lt;li>
                How many cars are there in the USA? (A popular variant is &amp;quot;How many gas 
                stations are there in the USA?&amp;quot;)
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                How many manhole covers are there in the USA?
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                You've got someone working for you for seven days and a gold bar to pay them. 
                The gold bar is segmented into seven connected pieces. You must give them a 
                piece of gold at the end of every day. If you are only allowed to make two 
                breaks in the gold bar, how do you pay your worker?
            &lt;/li>

            &lt;li>
                One train leaves Los Angeles at 15mph heading for New York. Another train 
                leaves from New York at 20mph heading for Los Angeles on the same track. If a 
                bird, flying at 25mph, leaves from Los Angeles at the same time as the train 
                and flies back and forth between the two trains until they collide, how far 
                will the bird have traveled?
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Imagine a disk spinning like a record player turn table. Half of the disk is 
                black and the other is white. Assume you have an unlimited number of color 
                sensors. How many sensors would you have to place around the disk to determine 
                the direction the disk is spinning? Where would they be placed?
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Imagine an analog clock set to 12 o'clock. Note that the hour and minute hands 
                overlap. How many times each day do both the hour and minute hands overlap? How 
                would you determine the exact times of the day that this occurs?
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>

                You have two jars, 50 red marbles and 50 blue marbles. A jar will be picked at 
                random, and &lt;i>then&lt;/i> a marble will be picked from the jar. Placing all of 
                the marbles in the jars, how can you maximize the chances of a red marble being 
                picked? What are the exact odds of getting a red marble using your scheme?
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Pairs of primes separated by a single number are called prime pairs. Examples 
                are 17 and 19. Prove that the number between a prime pair is always divisible 
                by 6 (assuming both numbers in the pair are greater than 6). Now prove that 
                there are no 'prime triples.'
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                There is a room with a door (closed) and three light bulbs. Outside the room 
                there are three switches, connected to the bulbs. You may manipulate the 
                switches as you wish, but once you open the door you can't change them. 
                Identify each switch with its bulb.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>

                Suppose you had 8 billiard balls, and one of them was slightly heavier, but the 
                only way to tell was by putting it on a scale against another. What's the 
                fewest number of times you'd have to use the scale to find the heavier ball?
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Imagine you are standing in front of a mirror, facing it. Raise your left hand. 
                Raise your right hand. Look at your reflection. When you raise your left hand 
                your reflection raises what appears to be his right hand. But when you tilt 
                your head up, your reflection does too, and does not appear to tilt his/her 
                head down. Why is it that the mirror appears to reverse left and right, but not 
                up and down?
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                You have 4 jars of pills. Each pill is a certain weight, except for 
                contaminated pills contained in one jar, where each pill is weight + 1. How 
                could you tell which jar had the contaminated pills in just one measurement?
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                The SF Chronicle has a word game where all the letters are scrambled up and you 
                have to figure out what the word is. Imagine that a scrambled word is 5 
                characters long:
            &lt;/li>

            &lt;ol>
                &lt;li>
                    How many possible solutions are there?
                &lt;/li>
                &lt;li>
                    What if we know which 5 letters are being used?
                &lt;/li>
                &lt;li>
                    Develop an algorithm to solve the word.
                &lt;/li>

            &lt;/ol>

                There are 4 women who want to cross a bridge. They all begin on the same side. 
                You have 17 minutes to get all of them across to the other side. It is night. 
                There is one flashlight. A maximum of two people can cross at one time. Any 
                party who crosses, either 1 or 2 people, must have the flashlight with them. 
                The flashlight must be walked back and forth, it cannot be thrown, etc. Each 
                woman walks at a different speed. A pair must walk together at the rate of the 
                slower woman's pace.
                &lt;p>
                    Woman 1: 1 minute to cross
                    &lt;br>
                    Woman 2: 2 minutes to cross
                    &lt;br>
                    Woman 3: 5 minutes to cross
                    &lt;br>
                    Woman 4: 10 minutes to cross
                    &lt;br>

                &lt;/p>
                &lt;p>
                    For example if Woman 1 and Woman 4 walk across first, 10 minutes have elapsed 
                    when they get to the other side of the bridge. If Woman 4 then returns with the 
                    flashlight, a total of 20 minutes have passed and you have failed the mission. 
                    What is the order required to get all women across in 17 minutes? Now, what's 
                    the other way?
                &lt;/p>

                If you had an infinite supply of water and a 5 quart and 3 quart pail, how

                You have a bucket of jelly beans. Some are red, some are blue, and some green. 
                With your eyes closed, pick out 2 of a like color. How many do you have to grab 
                to be sure you have 2 of the same?&lt;/li>

            &lt;li>
                If you have two buckets, one with red paint and the other with blue paint, and 
                you take one cup from the blue bucket and poor it into the red bucket. Then you 
                take one cup from the red bucket and poor it into the blue bucket. Which bucket 
                has the highest ratio between red and blue? Prove it mathematically.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>

                Implement an algorithm to do wild card string matching.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Implement strstr() (or some other string library function).

                Reverse a string. Optimize for speed. Optimize for space.

                Reverse the words in a sentence, i.e. &amp;quot;My name is Chris&amp;quot; becomes

                Suppose you have an array of 1001 integers. The integers are in random order, 
                but you know each of the integers is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). In 
                addition, each number appears only once in the array, except for one number, 
                which occurs twice. Assume that you can access each element of the array only 
                once. Describe an algorithm to find the repeated number. If you used auxiliary 
                storage in your algorithm, can you find an algorithm that does not require it?
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>

                Count the number of set bits in a number. Now optimize for speed. Now optimize

            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>

                Write routines to read and write a bounded buffer.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Write routines to manage a heap using an existing array.

            &lt;li>
                Implement an algorithm to take an array and return one with only unique

            &lt;li>
                Implement an algorithm that takes two strings as input, and returns the 
                intersection of the two, with each letter represented at most once. Now speed

                Given that you are receiving samples from an instrument at a constant rate, and 
                you have constant storage space, how would you design a storage algorithm that 
                would allow me to get a representative readout of data, no matter when I looked 
                at it? In other words, representative of the behavior of the system to date.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                How would you find a cycle in a linked list?

                Give me an algorithm to shuffle a deck of cards, given that the cards are

            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Imagine this scenario:
                &lt;br>
                I/O completion ports are communictaions ports which take handles to files, 
                sockets, or any other I/O. When a Read or Write is submitted to them, they 
                cache the data (if necessary), and attempt to take the request to completion. 
                Upon error or completion, they call a user-supplied function to let the users 
                application know that that particular request has completed. They work 
                asynchronously, and can process an unlimited number of simultaneous requests.
                &lt;br>

                Design the implementation and thread models for I/O completion ports. Remember 
                to take into account multi-processor machines.

                Write a function that takes in a string parameter and checks to see whether or 
                not it is an integer, and if it is then return the integer value.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Write a function to print all of the permutations of a string.

    <content type="html">&lt;h1>A Visit with the Visual C++ Team&lt;/h1>

        &lt;p>I spent a fun two days up at Microsoft last week at the Visual Studio 
        .NET C++ Authors Summit, wherein the Microsoft team shows us how cool 
        VS.NET is for C++ and browbeat us to write a book on the topic. Since 
        I'm already planning to write ATL Internals, 2/e with
        &lt;a href="mailto:kirk@pacificmindworks.com">Kirk Fertitta&lt;/a>, I couldn't 
        talk them out of the XBox I so richly deserve. On top of that, they 
        tortured me by taking me to the Microsoft store where they have XBox 
        games for only $10! Those bastards...&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>If you're a C++ programmer, VS.NET/VC7 brings a lot to the table. And 
        according to &lt;a href="mailto:nickhod@microsoft.com">Nick Hodapp&lt;/a>, a 
        PM on the VC team at Microsoft, many, many of you are C++ programmers. Microsoft 
        quoted some 3rd party studies that say that there are about 3M C++ 
        programmers out there (compared to 5M VB programmers and a whole lot 
        less Java programmers). From a 3rd party survey of 
         
        VC++ customers, Microsoft found that 90% (!) of them will be doing 
        the same or more VC++ work in the future (about 22 hours/week). They 
        also found that about 75% of VC++ users are MFC programmers (which isn't 
        growing) and 35% of them are ATL programmers (and is growing). Given the number of ATL7 books 
        shipping right now or in progress (ours and a few more), and the 
        increase in the audience, that  made Kirk, my Addison-Wesley 
        editor and me very, very happy.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Here are some other interesting tidbits from that survey for you:&lt;/p>
        &lt;ul>
          &lt;li>68% of VC++ developers build client-server apps&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>61% build desktop apps&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>51% build peer-to-peer apps (This number slays me. What are these 
          guys building?!?)&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>36% build embedded/CE apps&lt;/li>
          &lt;li>35% build NT services&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;p>While we were there, various members of the VC++ team attempted to 
        rock our world in terms of the new and improved features VC7. Sometimes 
        they succeeded. For example, &lt;a href="mailto:pranishk@microsoft.com">
        Pranish Kumar&lt;/a> told us how the ATL Server version of the Nile 
        benchmark web application was 10% faster than the hand-turned ISAPI 
        version in 1/4th the development time, which is why the Microsoft site 
        uses it for some of their &amp;quot;through-put challenged&amp;quot; areas. Also, Terry 
        Leeper showed us how make mini-dumps for VC++ projects that you can send to the 
        developer's who persist in saying &amp;quot;but it works on my machine...&amp;quot; He 
        also showed us how you can pause threads during debugging, load symbols 
        on demand, set breakpoints in DLLs that aren't loaded at start-up 
        (without that annoying dialog box) and just how much the new 
        optimization features can speed up your code (they did an amazing demo 
        with a recompiled Microsoft codedec that nearly doubled the frame rate 
        with no code changes).&lt;/p>
        &lt;p align="left">For those of you into ANSI compliance, Microsoft showed 
        off an early internal build of their compiler that raises VC's over 
        all compliance rating  to among the highest in the 
        industry. They are able to compile all of the popular 3rd party template 
        libraries, e.g. Loki, Boost, Blitz++, POOMA and a complete STL.&lt;/p>
