We've got members of the Longhorn team looking everywhere for your feedback. For example, yesterday &lt;A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/archive/2004/02/05/67911.aspx">Dino posted&lt;/A> a theory he had about developer reaction to some particular aspect of the new Longhorn programming model. &lt;A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rrelyea/">Rob Relyea&lt;/A>&amp;nbsp;saw that post and today &lt;A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rrelyea/archive/2004/02/06/2374.aspx">he's soliciting more feedback on XAML compound property syntax&lt;/A> and &lt;A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rrelyea/archive/2004/02/06/2375.aspx">XAML as a whole&lt;/A>, the latter specifically becase of Dino's post.&lt;/P>

&lt;P>The key trick in Ian's implementation is putting a hidden &amp;lt;Rectangle&amp;gt; element into your XAML document so that when it's time to do the rubber hand outline, you can show it, move it and resize it based on where the mouse is, hiding the Rectangle again when the mouse button is released. This lets Avalon take care of the drawing, making this technique a thing of beauty.&lt;/P></content>
