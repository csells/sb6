I was crying wolf a bit when I said that blogs/openness would put authors like me out of work. It might put some authors/consultants/speakers out of work, but as Mike Abercrombie at DevelopMentor used to say, "There's always room in the market for quality." Or, in other words, there will always be a need for *good* books, articles, conference talks, training courses, etc.

I'll just have to try to write well from now on, that's all. : )

P.S. I appreciate all the offers of encouragement and hugs that I got from this post [1]. It's nice to know folks care and hard to believe that anyone would ever consider me "subtle." On the other hand, I was accused of claiming to have invented Java the other day, so maybe I need to post another naked picture or something... : )</content>
