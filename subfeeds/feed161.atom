Currently you can only perform XML Diff through the web page, but the assembly should be available on that site very soon.  I think it is considerably better than anything else available today, in terms of both performance and accuracy, and the API is a good fit with the System.Xml libraries, so it should be really easy for any VB/J#/C#/F# programmers to use."
