&lt;P>I'm running Vista Ultimate, and while I can't tell what's "ultimate" about it, it feels about time to make Vista the OS on my main computer. Certainly my sons like it on their computer, which is the real test.&lt;/P></content>

    <summary>Scott created his podcast with the idea of not wasting his listeners' time and he's done it. HanselMinutes is the only podcast I listen to. In fact, I prepared for&amp;nbsp;a long car drive by filling my phone w/ episodes I hadn't hear yet and listened all the way (except when I called Scott to complain about one of them : ). Not only does Scott have a fabulous list of topics for the Windows developer, but the way he explains them is wonderful, too.

&lt;P>Scott created his podcast with the idea of not wasting his listeners' time and he's done it. &lt;A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">HanselMinutes&lt;/A> is the only podcast I listen to. In fact, I prepared for&amp;nbsp;a long car drive by filling my phone w/ episodes I hadn't hear yet and listened all the way (except when I called Scott to complain about one of them : ).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Not only does Scott have a fabulous list of topics for the Windows developer, but the way he explains them is wonderful, too. I don't know where the guy finds the time to do all the stuff he talks about; I'm jealous!&lt;/P>
&lt;P>In fact, I'm so enamored of his show, I've been trying to horn my way onto an episode (and not just 'cuz &lt;A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=34">he had very nice things to say about me recently&lt;/A> [19:53&amp;nbsp;- 21:12]). I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but either way, if you only listen to one podcaster this year, it should be &lt;A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Scott&lt;/A>.&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>It's easy to think that if you're already got a high page rank in google, that you'll get more than your far share of traffic, polarizing the internet into a small number of sites that get all the hits. Luckily, according to "&lt;A href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0605525103v1">Topical interests and the mitigation of search engine bias&lt;/A>," published in &lt;A href="http://www.pnas.org/">the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/A>, that's not the case:&lt;/P>
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
&lt;P>&lt;EM>"Our result has relevant conceptual and practical consequences; it suggests that, contrary to intuition and prior hypotheses, the use of search engines contributes to a more level playing field in which new sites have a greater chance of being discovered and thus of acquiring links and popularity, as long as they are about specific topics that match the interests of users as expressed through their search queries."&lt;/EM>&lt;/P>&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt;P>In other words, if you've got something relevant to say, the folks that care will find it. Yet again, letting the internet decide yields the best result.&lt;/P>
