&lt;P>Long-time readers may recall when I got &lt;A href="/2089">an angry caller from a Vista user&lt;/A> that had trouble configuring it the way they wanted it. They got to me because they were looking for "sales" using the automated voice attendant that matched my last name instead ("Sells") and forwarded him to me in the middle of a 1:1 in my office. Not wanting to let a customer go away angry, I stopped what I was doing and did my best to try to help.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>It happened again today, except for an angry middle-aged guy, I got a call from the sweetest 12-year-old girl you'd ever want to talk to. Her Word CD had gotten scratched and she needed a replacement so she could write a big paper due next week. I considered telling her that I wasn't in sales or support or getting her number and calling her back (I was IM'ing with four other people at the time and I was late for a meeting), but she was so earnest that I just couldn't turn her away.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Instead, I took her name, address and email, went to the MS store and purchased her a copy of Office 2007, which I then had sent to her place via 2-day shipping, all the time assuring her that it wouldn't cost her a dime. I ended up using my own personal quota for discounted software and charging $60 to my MS AMEX, but I would've spent my own money (and still might if my boss reads this and rejects my expense report : ).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>She was so grateful and it made my day to solve her problem. I love our customers and I hope the terrible robot on the main MS line keeps sending 'em my way.&lt;/P></content>

While Oslo has no direct support for the incremental migration strategy to migrate DSL documents forward, we absolutely provide the tools for building it yourself. We do have very nice support for model-based migration, which keeps a parser around for each version of the DSL and produces the same underlying semantic model (which we call MGraph). </summary>

&lt;P>Rocky makes some good points in his recent piece on DSLs (&lt;A class=TitleLinkStyle href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/DSLsNdashFunCoolButMaybeABadIdea.aspx" rel=bookmark>DSLs &amp;#8211; fun, cool, but maybe a bad idea?&lt;/A> ) -- basically, who's going to learn the DSL when the folks that know it move on? That's one potential downside of the proliferation of DSLs and I could give you more.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>However, all technologies come with these downsides, e.g. &lt;/P>
&lt;UL>
&lt;LI>Managed environments make new programmers forget what's under the hood (and in some cases, actually afraid to look).&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>Horseless carriages produce pollution.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>iPhones are killing the English language by encouraging the use of "words" like "lol," "afaik" and "wtf."&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>Airplanes crash.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>Very very bad code written in Visual Basic can still do the right thing.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>Fonts let every letter look like a ransom note.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>etc.&lt;/LI>&lt;/UL>
&lt;P>The point isn't whether a technology has downsides or not -- of course, it does. The point is whether the upsides outweigh the downsides. In the case of DSLs and model-driven development all up, the "Oslo" team is making a big bet that we can make you overall more productive when digging ourselves out of the IT software backlog hole. Will we be? I think so, but we have a lot of work to do before we'll know for sure.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>And how do we reduce the impact of the downsides of a new technology? By knowing that they're there, which is why &lt;A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/DSLsNdashFunCoolButMaybeABadIdea.aspx">Rocky's commentary&lt;/A> is so useful. Recommended.&lt;/P></content>
