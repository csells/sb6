    <title>LINQ Has Changed Me</title>

    <summary>In the old days, the post-colonial, pre-LINQ days of yore, I’d have written a one-way MD5 encryption like so: static string GetMD5String( string s) { MD5 md5 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider(); byte [] hash = md5.ComputeHash(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(s)); StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); foreach ( byte b in hash ) sb.AppendFormat( &amp;quot;{0:x2}&amp;quot;, b); return sb.ToString();

  &lt;span class="kwrd">return&lt;/span> sb.ToString();
}&lt;/pre>
&lt;style type="text/css">



.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, "Courier New", courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;

&lt;p>This implementation is fine and has served me well for 10 years (I pulled it out of &lt;a href="/12426">the first .NET project I ever really did&lt;/a>). However, after using LINQ for so long, it’s hard not to see every problem as an operation over sets:&lt;/p>

&lt;pre class="csharpcode">&lt;span class="kwrd">static&lt;/span> &lt;span class="kwrd">string&lt;/span> GetMD5String(&lt;span class="kwrd">string&lt;/span> s) {

    ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(s)). 
    Aggregate(&lt;span class="kwrd">new&lt;/span> StringBuilder(), (working, b) =&amp;gt; working.AppendFormat(&lt;span class="str">&amp;quot;{0:x2}&amp;quot;&lt;/span>, b)). 
    ToString(); 
} &lt;/pre>

}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }&lt;/style>I can’t say that the LINQ version is any better, but it felt better. However, you’ll notice that I’m not using any of the LINQ keywords, e.g. “select”, “where”, etc. I find that I don’t really use them that much. It’s too jarring to mix them, e.g. “(from f in foos select f).Take(3)”, since not everything has a LINQ keyword equivalent. I tend to do “LINQ-less LINQ” more often then not.&lt;/p>

    <title>A Function That Forces</title>

    <summary>At Microsoft, there’s this passive-aggressive cultural thing called a “forcing function,” which, to put it crudely, is an engineering way for us to control the behavior of others. The idea is that you set up something to happen, like a meeting or an event, that will “force” a person or group to do something that you want them to do.

The idea is that you set up something to happen, like a meeting or an event, that will “force” a person or group to do something that you want them to do.&lt;/p>  &lt;p>For example, if someone won’t answer your email, you can set up a meeting on their calendar. Since Microsoft is a meeting-oriented culture (even though we all hate them), a ‘softie will be very reticent to decline your meeting request. So, they have a choice – they can attend your meeting so that they can answer your question in person or they can answer your email and get that time back in their lives. This kind of forcing function can take larger forms as well. I can’t say that our execs make the decision like this (since they don’t talk to me : ), but it is the case that signing up a large number of Microsoft employees to host and speak at important industry events does have the effect of making us get together to ensure that our technologies and our descriptions of those technologies holds together (well, holds together better than they would otherwise : ).&lt;/p>  &lt;p>Unfortunately, this way of thinking has become so much a part of me that I’ve started to use it on my family (which they very much do not like). Worse, I use it on myself.&lt;/p>  &lt;p>For example, I have been holding back on half a dozen or more blog posts until I have the software set up on &lt;a href="/12670">my newly minted web site&lt;/a> to handle blog posts in a modern way, namely via &lt;a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer">Windows Live Writer&lt;/a>. In other words, I was using the pressure inherent in the build up of blogging topics to motivate me to build the support I wanted into sellsbrothers.com to have a secure blogging endpoint for WLW. Before I moved all my content into a database, I could just pull up FrontPage/Expression Web and type into static HTML. Now that everything is data-driven, however, the content for my posts are just rows in a database. As much as I love SQL Server Management Studio, it doesn’t yet have HTML editing support that I consider adequate. Further, getting images into my database was very definitely a programming task not handled by existing tools that I was familiar with.&lt;/p>  &lt;p>So, this is the first post using my new WLW support and I’m damn proud of it. It was work that I did with Kent Sharkey, a close friend of mine that most resembles &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeyore">Eeyore&lt;/a> in temperament and facial expressions, and that just made it all the more fun!&lt;/p>  &lt;p>Anyway, I’m happy with the results of my forcing function and I’ll post the code and all the details ASAP, but I just wanted to apologize for my relative silence on this blog and that things should get better RSN. XXOO.&lt;/p>  &lt;p>P.S. I’m loving Windows Live Writer 11!&lt;/p>  </content>

The data I was checking was my gmail account and whenever there was new mail, I'd pop up a notification. All very simple, so to be funny, instead of saying 
&amp;quot;You've got mail,&amp;quot;� my program said &amp;quot;I's time to check the donuts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over time, I came to rely on this app but lamented the lack of features, like 
seeing who the email was from or marking an email as read w/o logging in, etc. Over time, I came to wish I had something like
&lt;a href="http://download.cnet.com/Gmail-Notifier/3000-2369_4-10914118.html">Gmail Notifier&lt;/a>. I's free and while it doesn't contain an 
'80s commercial reference, it has way more features than I ever built into mine. 
Oh, and the noise it makes when you get an email is priceless. Recommended.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have an iPhone 4.0. Normally when it's driving me crazy, it's standard 
stuff like the battery life sucks or that the iOS 4.0.1 update didn't fix the 
proximity detection or stop emails I send via Exchange from just disappearing 
into the ether.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, it's something else and I can't blame the iPhone; I think all 
modern smart phones have the same problem. The problem is that I constantly have 
to switch between apps to see my messages. Here are screenshots for 5 of the 
messaging clients I use reguarly:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img alt="Voicemail" style="margin: 5px;" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0071.PNG" width="320">
&lt;img alt="Exchange Email" style="margin: 5px;" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0072.PNG" width="320">
&lt;img alt="SMS/MMS" style="margin: 5px;" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0073.PNG" width="320">
&lt;img alt="Facebook" style="margin: 5px;" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0074.PNG" width="320">
&lt;img alt="Twitter" style="margin: 5px;" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0075.PNG" width="320">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This list doesn't include real-time messages like IM, or notifications like 
Twitter or RSS. I'm just talking about plain ol' async messaging. We used to 
think of it as &amp;quot;email,&amp;quot; but really voicemail, email, SMS, MMS, Facebook messages 
and Twitter Direct Messages are all the same -- they are meant to queue up until 
you get to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, some folks would argue that SMS/MMS aren't meant to be queued; they're 
meant to be seen and handled immediately. Personally, I find it annoying that 
there is a pop-up for every single text or media messages I get on my phone and 
there seems to be no way to turn that off. On the other hand, if I want that to 
happen for other types of messages, e.g. voicemail, I can find no way to turn it 
on even if I want to. Why are text messages special, especially since most 
mobile clients let you get over the 160 character limit and will just send them 
one after the other for you anyway?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iOS 4 takes a step in the right direction with the &amp;quot;universal&amp;quot; inbox:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img alt="iOS4 &amp;quot;universal&amp;quot; inbox" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0070.PNG" width="320">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here I've got a great UI for getting to all my email messages at once, but 
why can't it handle all my messages instead?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img alt="super-universal inbox" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0069.PNG" width="320">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not only would this put all my messages in one place at one time, but it 
would unify up the UI and preferences across the various messaging sources. Do 
you want your text messages to quietly queue up like email? Done. Do you want 
your voicemail to pop to the front like an SMS? Done. Do you want the same 
swipe-to-delete gestures on your voicemail as you have with your email? Done!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe someone with some experience on the new Windows Phone 7 can tell me 
that there is a &amp;quot;messaging&amp;quot; hub that manages all this for me. Since they're 
already doing things like bringing facebook pictures into the &amp;quot;pictures&amp;quot; hub (or 
whatever they call it), that doesn't seem completely out of the realm of 
possibility. If that's the case, I'll say again what I've been saying for a 
while -- I can't wait for my Windows Phone 7!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>David Ramel from &lt;a href="http://1105media.com">1105media.com&lt;/a> is writing an article that includes the Microsoft interviewing process and he send me some questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>&lt;strong>[David] &lt;/strong>How would you succinctly sum up the Microsoft interview process as compared to those of other tech companies?
&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>[Chris] &lt;/strong>MS does some things similarly to other high-tech companies I've worked with, e.g. having each interviewer focus on an aspect or aspects, e.g. team skills, people skills, technical skills, etc., expecting a candidate to ask questions, communicating between interviewers to push more on one area or another, etc. The riddle questions are a uniqueness at Microsoft (at least they were when I last interviewed), but theyire pretty rare these days. Coding on the whiteboard also seems pretty unique to Microsoft (myself, I prefer the keyboard : ).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>&lt;strong>[David] &lt;/strong>How has the Microsoft interview process changed over time? (Microsoft seems to have shaken up the tech interview process some years ago with those brain-teasing puzzle� questions, but now seem to be much more technically-oriented and job-specific. Just wondering about your thoughts on this observation.)
&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>[Chris] &lt;/strong>While I have had them, puzzle questions were rare even when I was interviewed 7 years ago. Since then, I haven't run into many people that use them. However, when they are used, an interviewer is often looking for how a candidate works through an issue as much as the solution that they come up with. In an ever changing world, being able to learn and adapt quickly is a huge part of how successfully you can be in the tech industry at all and at Microsoft specifically. I prefer technical design questions for these kinds of results, however, and it seems that most 
'softies agree.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>&lt;strong>[David] &lt;/strong>What would you say was the biggest factor in your being offered a job at Microsoft?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>[Chris] &lt;/strong>I had a reputation outside of MS before I interviewed, but that almost didn't matter. If I hadn't done well during the interview, I would not have been offered the job. When in doubt, a team generally prefers to turn away a good candidate rather than to risk taking on a bad one, so if there's anything wrong, team fit, technical ability, role fit, etc., a candidate won't get an offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>&lt;strong>[David] &lt;/strong>What's the single most important piece of advice you can offer to those preparing for a Microsoft job interview?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>[Chris] &lt;/strong>You asked for just one, but I'm going to give you two anyway. : )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;ol>
&lt;li>If you need more information to answer a question, ask for it. Thatis how the real-world works and many questions are intentionally vague to simulate just this kind of interaction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try to answer non-technical questions based on your personal experience, e.g. instead of saying 
&amp;quot;here's how I would deal with that situation,&amp;quot;� say &amp;quot;I had a similar situation in my past and hereis how I dealt with it.&amp;quot;� This is a style of interviewing known as 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_interview#Behavioral">behavioral�&lt;/a> and even if your interviewer doesn't phrase his questions in that way, e.g. 
&amp;quot;give me an example of how you dealt with a situation like blah,&amp;quot;� it's helpful and impressive if you can use your own history to pull out a positive result.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>[David] &lt;/strong>Could you please share any other observations you have on the Microsoft interview process that may not be covered in your site or the Jobsblog?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>[Chris] &lt;/strong>I run &lt;a href="/interview">a little section of my web site dedicated to the MS interviewing process&lt;/a> and the thing I will tell you is this: don't prepare. Be yourself. If you're not a fit for MS, no amount of preparation in the days before an interview will help and if you are a fit, that will come through in the interview. Also, make sure you ask questions. Working at Microsoft isn't just a job, it's a way of life, so make sure you're sure you want the team and the job for which you're interviewing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>&lt;strong>[David] &lt;/strong>Does MS provide training for interviewers? If so, what do they stress most?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>[Chris] &lt;/strong>I'm sure MS does provide training for interviewing, but Iive never been to it. At Intel, I learned the behavioral interviewing technique, which Iive used in every interview since, both as an interviewer and as a job candidate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>[David] Do you have standard questions, or do you tailor them to the situation? If the latter, is it usually tailored for team fit, to a specific open position, particular skills, etc.?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>[Chris] &lt;/strong>I have once standard technique question and a few standard behavioral interview questions. The technical question is to ask them what their favorite technology is and/or what they consider themselves to be an expert� in and then drill in on their understanding. If they can answer my questions deeply, this shows passion about technology and the ability to learn something well, both of which are crucial for success at MS.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
My behavioral interviewing questions are things like &amp;quot;Tell me about a time when youive been in conflict with a peer. How did you resolve it? What was the result? What did you learn?&amp;quot;� and 
&amp;quot;Tell me about a time when you had much too much work to do in the time you were given. How do you resolve that issue? What was the result? What did you learn?&amp;quot;� The core idea of behavioral interviewing is that past behavior indicates future behavior, so instead of asking people things like 
&amp;quot;How &lt;em>would &lt;/em>you deal with such-and-such?�&amp;quot; you ask them &amp;quot;How &lt;em>did
&lt;/em>you dealt with such-and-such in the past?&amp;quot;� This forces them to find a matching scenario and you get to see if they way they dealt with the issue in real life matches what you want from a team mate in that job.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>&lt;strong>[David] &lt;/strong>How would you describe the kinds of coding questions you ask? A couple of real examples would be perfect!
&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>[Chris] &lt;/strong>I don't often ask coding questions, but when I have, I let them use a keyboard. I hate coding on the board myself as it's not representative of how people actually code, so I don't find it to be a good indicator of what people will actually do. I guess I even use behavioral techniques for technical questions, now that I think about it. : )&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Often when I'm building my MVC 2 application using Visual Studio 2010, I get

On the internet&lt;/a>, this error seems to be related to having a nested 
web.config in your application. I do have such a thing, but it's just the one 
that came out of the MVC 2 project item template and I haven't touched it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>
In my case, this error in my case doesn't seem to have anything to do with a 
nested web.config. This 
error only started to happen when I began using the web site deployment features 
in VS2010 which by itself, rocks (see Scott Hanselman's
&lt;a href="http://blogs.iis.net/shanselman/archive/2010/03/24/web-deployment-made-awesome-if-you-re-using-xcopy-you-re-doing-it-wrong.aspx">
&amp;quot;Web Deployment Made Awesome: If You're Using XCopy, You're Doing It Wrong&amp;quot;&lt;/a> 
for details).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&amp;nbsp;If it happens to you and it doesn't seem to make any sense, you can try to 
fix it with a Build Clean command. If you're using to previous versions of 
Visual Studio, you'll be surprised, like I was, not to find a Clean option in 
sparse the Build menu. Instead, you can only get to it by right-clicking on your 
project in the Solution Explorer and choosing Clean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Doing that, however, seems to make the error go away. I don't think that's a 
problem with my app; I think that's a problem with VS2010.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The new sellsbrothers.com implementation has been a while in the making. In fact, I've had the final art in my hands 
since August of 2005. I've tried several times to sit down and rebuild my 
15-year-old sellsbrothers.com completely from scratch using the latest tools. 
This time, I had a book contract (&amp;quot;Programming Data,&amp;quot; Addison-Wesley, 2010) and 
I needed some real-world experience with Entity Framework 4.0 and OData, so I 
fired up Visual Studio 2010 a coupla months ago and went to town.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>The Data Modeling&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first thing I did was design my data model. I started very small with 
just Post and Comment. That was enough to get most of my content in. And that 
lead to my first principle (we all need principles):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>thou shalt have no .html files served from the file system.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On my old site, I had a mix of static and dynamic content which lead to all 
kinds of trouble. This time, the HTML at least was going to be all dynamic. So, once I had my 
model defined, I had to import all of my static data into my live system. For 
that, I needed a tool to parse the static HTML and pull out structured data. 
Luckily, &lt;a href="http://haacked.com/">Phil Haack&lt;/a> came to my rescue here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before he was a Microsoft employee in charge of MVC, Phil was well-known 
author of &lt;a href="http://subtextproject.com/">the SubText open source CMS project&lt;/a>. A few years ago, in one of my 
aborted attempts to get my site into a reasonable state (it has evolved from a 
single static text file into a mish-mash of static and dynamic content over 15 
years), I asked Phil to help me get my site moved over to SubText. To help me 
out, he built 
the tool that parsed my static HTML, transforming the data into the SubText database format. 
For this, all I had to do was transform the 
data from his format into mine, but before I could do that, I had to hook my 
schema up to a real-live datastore. I didn't want to have to take old web site 
down at all; I wanted to have both sites up and running at the same time. This 
lead to principle #2:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>thou shalt keep both web sites running with the existing live set of 
data.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And, in fact, that's what happened. For many weeks while I was building my 
new web site, I was dumping static data into the live database. However, since 
my old web site sorting things by date, there was only one place to even see 
this old data being put in (the &lt;a href="/">/news/archive.aspx&lt;/a> page). Otherwise, it was all 
imperceptible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make this happen, I had to map my new data model onto my existing data. I 
could do this in one of two ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
	&lt;li>I could create the new schema on my ISP-hosted SQL Server 2008 database 
	(&lt;a href="http://securewebs.com">securewebs.com&lt;/a> rocks, btw -- highly recommended!) and move the data over.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I could use my existing schema and just map it on the client-side using 
	the wonder and beauty that was EF4.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Since I was trying to get real-world experience with our data stack, I tried 
to use the tools and processes that a real-world developer has and they often don't 
get to change the database without a real need, especially on a running system. So, I went with option #2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And 
I'm so glad I did. It worked really, really well to change names and select 
fields I cared about or didn't care about all from the client-side without ever 
touching the database. Sometimes I had to make database changes and when that happened, I 
has careful and deliberate, making the case to my inner DB administrator, but 
mostly I just didn't have to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And when I needed whole new tables of data, that lead to another principle:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>build out all new tables in my development environment first.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This way, I could make sure they worked in my new environment and could 
refactor to my heart's content before disturbing my (inner) DB admin with 
request after request to change a live, running database. I used a very simple 
repository pattern in my MVC2 web site to hide the fact that I was actually 
accessing two databases, so when I switched everything to a single database, 
none of my view or controller code had to change. Beautiful!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Data Wants To Be Clean&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And even though I was careful to keep my schema the same on the backend and 
map it as I wanted in my new web site via EF, not all of my old data worked in my new 
world. For example, I was building a web site on my local box, so anything with 
a hard-coded link to sellsbrothers.com had to be changed. Also, I was using a 
set of &amp;lt;a name=&amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; ? elements to reference specific posts in my static HTML that just didn't 
scale to my dynamic ID-based permalinks, so data had to be &amp;quot;cleaned.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this cleaning, I used a combination of 
&lt;a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad&lt;/a>, 
&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms174173.aspx">SSMS&lt;/a> and EF-based C# 
code to perform data cleaning tasks. This yielded two tools that I'm still 
using:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>BlogEdit: &lt;/strong>An unimagintively named general-purpose post 
	and comment creation and editing tool. I built the first version of this 
	long before WPF, so kept hacking on it in WinForms (whose data binding sucks 
	compared to WPF, btw) as I needed it to have new features. Eventually I gave 
	this tool WYSIWIG HTML editing by shelling out to Expression Web, but I need 
	real AtomPub support on the site so I can move to Windows Live Writer for 
	that functionality in the future.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>BulkChangeDatabaseTable: &lt;/strong>This was an app that I'd use 
	to run my questions to find &amp;quot;dirty&amp;quot; data, perform regular expression 
	replaces with and then -- and this is the best part -- show the changes in 
	WinDiff so I could make sure I was happy with the changes before commiting 
	them to the database. This extra eyeballing saved me from wrecking a bunch 
	of data.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>During this data cleaning, I applied one simple rule that I adopted early and 
always regretted when I ignored:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>thou shalt throw away no data&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if the data didn't seem to have any use in the new world, I kept it. And 
it's a good thing I did, because I always, always needed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, when I ran Phil's tool to parse my static web pages, he pulled 
out the &amp;lt;a name=&amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; tags that went with all of my static posts. I wasn't 
going to use them to build permalinks, why did I need them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'll tell you why: because I've got 2600 posts in my blog from 15 years of 
doing this, I cross-link to my own content all the live-long day and a bunch of 
those cross-links are to, you guessed it, to what used to be static data. So, I 
have to turn links embedded in my content of the form &amp;quot;/writing/#footag&amp;quot; into 
links of the form &amp;quot;/posts/details/452&amp;quot;. But how do I look up the mapping between 
&amp;quot;footag&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;452&amp;quot;? That's right -- I actually went to my (inner) DB admin and 
begged him for a new column on my live database called &amp;quot;EntryName&amp;quot; where I 
tucked the &amp;lt;a name=&amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; data as I imported the data from Phil's tool, even 
though I didn't know why I might need it. It was a good principle.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Forwarding Old Links&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And how did I even figure out I had all those broken links? Well, I asked my 
good friend and web expert Kent Sharkey how to make sure my site was at least 
internally consist before I shipped it and he recommended
&lt;a href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html">Xenu Link Sleuth&lt;/a> for the 
job. This lead to another principle:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>thou shalt ship the new site with no broken internal links&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which was followed closely by another principle:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>thou shalt not stress over broken links to external content.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just because I'm completely anal about making sure every link I ever pass out 
to the world stays valid for all eternity doesn't mean that the rest of the 
world is similiarly anal. That's a shame, but there's nothing I can do if little 
sites like microsoft.com decide to move things without a forwarding address. I 
can, however, make sure that all of my links worked internally and I used Xenu 
to do that. I started out with several hundred broken links and before I shipped 
the new site, I had zero.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not all of that was changing old content, however. In fact, most of it 
wasn't. Because I wanted existing external links out in the world to find the 
same content in the new place, I had to make sure the old links still worked. That's not to say I was a slave to the old URL format, however. I didn't 
want to expose .aspx extensions. I wanted to do things the new, cool, MVC way, 
i.e. instead of /news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=452 (my old format), I wanted 
/posts/details/452. So, this lead to a new principle:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>thou shalt built the new web site the way you want and make the old URLs 
work externally.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was using MVC and I wanted to do it right. That meant laying out the &amp;quot;URL 
space&amp;quot; the way it made sense in the new world (and it's much nicer in general, 
imo). However, instead of changing my content to use this new URL schema, I used 
it as a representative sample of how links to my content in the real-world might 
be coming into my site, which gave me initial data about what URLs I needed to 
forward. Ongoing, I'll dig through 404 logs to find the rest and make those URLs 
work appropriately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used a few means of forwarding the old URLs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mapping sub-folders to categories: &lt;/strong>In the old site, I 
	physically had the files in folders that matched the sub-folders, e.g. /fun 
	mapped to /fun/default.aspx. In the new world, /fun meant 
	/posts/details/?category=fun. This sub-folder thing only works for the set 
	of well-defined categories on the site (all of which are entries in the 
	database, of course), but if you want to do sub-string search across 
	categories on my site you can, e.g. /posts/details/?category=foo.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>Kept sub-folder URLs&lt;/strong>, e.g. /tinysells and /writing: I 
	still liked these URLs, so I kept them and built controllers to handle them.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.iis.net/download/URLRewrite">&lt;strong>Using the IIS 
	URL Rewriter&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>&lt;strong>: &lt;/strong>This was the big gun.
	&lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/">Jon Galloway&lt;/a>, who was 
	invaluable in this work, turned me onto it and I'm glad he did. The URL 
	Rewriter is a small, simple add-in to IIS7 that lets you describe patterns and rules for 
	forwarding when those patterns are matched. I have something like a dozen 
	patterns that do the work to forward 100s of URLs that are in my own content 
	and might be out in the world. And it works so, so well. Highly recommended.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So, with a combination of data cleaning to make my content work across both 
the old site and the new site under development, making some of my old URLs work 
because of conventions I adopted that I wanted to keep and URL rewriting, I had 
a simple, feature-complete, 100% data-driven re-implementation of 
sellsbrothers.com. &lt;/p>
&lt;h2>What's New?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Of course, I couldn't just reimplement the site without doing something new:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>Way, way faster. &lt;/strong>SQL Server 2008 and EF4 make the site 
	noticibly faster. I love it. Surfing from my box, as soon as the browser 
	window is visible, I'm looking at the content on my site. What's better than 
	that?&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>I made tinysells.com work again&lt;/strong>, e.g.
	&lt;a href="http://tinysells.com/42">tinysells.com/42&lt;/a>. I broke when I moved 
	it from simpleurl.com to godaddy.com. Luckily, godaddy.com was just 
	forwarding to sellsbrothers.com/tinysells/&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;, so that was easy to 
	implement with a MVC controller. That was all data I already had in the 
	database because John Elliot, another helper I had on the site a while ago, 
	set it up for me.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>I added reCAPTCHA support: &lt;/strong>Now I'm hoping I won't have 
	to moderate comments at all. So far, so good. Also, I added the ability to 
	add HTML content, which is encoded, so it comes right back the way it went 
	in, i.e. no action scripts or links or anything a spammer would want but the 
	characters a coder wants putting content into a technical blog.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>Per category ATOM and OData feeds&lt;/strong> (and RSS feeds, too, 
	if you care). For example, if you click on the ATOM or OData icons on the 
	home page, you'll get the feed for everything. However, if you click on it 
	on one of the category pages, e.g. &lt;a href="/fun">/fun&lt;/a>, you'll get a feed filtered by 
	category.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>Paging in OData and HTML: &lt;/strong>This lets you scroll to the 
	bottom of both the OData feed and the HTML page to scroll backwards and 
	forwards in time.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>New layout&lt;/strong> including fixed-sized content area for 
	readability, google ads and bing search (I'd happily replace google ads with 
	bing ads if they'd let me).&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>Nearly every sub-page is category driven&lt;/strong>, although even 
	the ones that aren't, e.g. &lt;a href="/tinysells">/tinysells&lt;/a> and 
	&lt;a href="/writing">/writing&lt;/a> and still completely 
	data-driven. Further, the writing page is so data-driven that if the data is 
	just an ISDN, it creates an ASIN associate ID for amazon.com. Buy those 
	books, people! : )&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2>The Room for Improvement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As always, there's a long list of things I wish I had time to do:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>The way I handle layout&lt;/strong> is with tables 'cuz I couldn't 
	figure out how to make CSS do what I wanted. I'd love expert help!&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>Space preservation in comments so code is formatted correctly.&lt;/strong> 
	I don't actually know the right way to go about this.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;strong>Blog Conversations: &lt;/strong>The idea here is to let folks put 
	their email on a forum comment so that when someone else comments, they're 
	notified. This happens on forums and Facebook now and I like it for 
	maintaining a conversation over time.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>In spite of my principle, &lt;strong>I didn't get 100% of the HTML content 
	on the site into the database&lt;/strong>. Some of the older, obscure stuff is 
	still in HTML. It's still reachable, but I haven't motivated myself to get 
	every last scrap. I will.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I can easily &lt;strong>expose more via OData&lt;/strong>. I can't think why 
	not to and who knows what folks might want to do with the data.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I could make the site a little &lt;strong>more readable on mobile devices&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I really need &lt;strong>full support for AtomPub&lt;/strong> so I can use 
	Windows Live Writer.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I'd like to add the name of the article into the URL (apparently search 
	engines like that kind of thing : ).&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Pulling &lt;strong>book covers on the writing page&lt;/strong> from the ISBN number 
	would liven up the joint, I think.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Pass the &lt;a href="http://www.iis.net/download/SEOToolkit">SEO Toolkit&lt;/a> check. (I'm 
	not so great just now.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Luckily, with the infrastructure I've got in place now, laying in these 
features over time will be easy, which was the whole point of doing this work in 
the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Where are we?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All of this brings me back to one more principle. I call it Principle Zero:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>thou shalt make everything data-driven.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm living the data-driven application dream here, people. When designing my 
data model and writing my code, I imagined that sellsbrothers.com was but one instance of a class of web 
applications and I kept all of the content, down to my name and email address, 
in the database. If I found myself putting data into the code, I figured out 
where it belonged in the database instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lead to all kinds of real-world uses of the database features of Visual Studio, including EF, OData, Database 
projects, SQL execution, live table-based data editing, etc. I lived the 
data-driven dream and it yielded a web site that's much faster and runs on much 
less code:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>Old site:&lt;ul>
		&lt;li>191 .aspx file, 286 KB&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>400 .cs file,&amp;nbsp; 511 KB&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
	&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>New site:&lt;ul>
		&lt;li>14 .aspx files, 19 KB&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>34 .cs files,&amp;nbsp; 80 KB&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
	&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Do the math and that's 100+% of the content and functionality for 10% of the 
code. I knew I wanted to do it to gain experience with our end-to-end data stack 
story. I had no idea I would love it so much.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are two problems. The first problem is that we're not reporting the 
problem very well. You can't see what's happening in IE8 with a simple View 
Source, as apparently IE won't show malformed XML. Instead, you have to use
&lt;a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler&lt;/a> or some other tool (I'm 
a big &lt;a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/tcptrace/">tcpTrace&lt;/a> fan) to see the 
actual error in the HTTP response:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&amp;lt;m:message xml:lang=&amp;quot;en-US&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Internal Server Error. The type
'System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.Post_CF2ABE5AD0B93AE51D470C9FDFD72E780956A6FD7294E0B4205C6324E1053422'
is not a complex type or an entity type.&amp;lt;/m:message&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/m:error&amp;gt;&lt;/strong>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's in the creation of the OData feed that the error happens, so instead of 
clearing the response and just returning the error, we dump it into the middle 
of the output, making it very difficult to find. In this case, what we're 
telling you is that you've mistakenly left dynamic proxy creation on, which 
doesn't work with EF4 POCO objects and Data Services in .NET 4.0. To fix this, 
you need to override the CreateDataSource method in your DataService&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; derived 
class:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>public class MyODataEndpoint : DataService&amp;lt;FooEntities&amp;gt; {
  public static void InitializeService(DataServiceConfiguration config) {
    ...
  }

&lt;strong>  protected override sellsbrothersEntities CreateDataSource() {
    var dataSource = new FooEntities();
    dataSource.ContextOptions.ProxyCreationEnabled = false;
    return dataSource;
  }
&lt;/strong>}&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This solution came from Shyam Pather, a Dev Manager on the EF team. He says 
that once you turn off proxy generation, you give up lazy loading and 
&amp;quot;immediate&amp;quot; change tracking. Instead, you'll get &amp;quot;snapshot&amp;quot; change tracking, 
which means the context won't be informed when the properites are changed, but the context 
still detects changes when you call DetectChanges() or SaveChanges(). For the internals of 
a Data Service, none of this matters, but any code you write in query interceptors, change interceptors, or service 
operations will have to be aware of this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This limitations are only true when used from the OData endpoint, of course. 
The rest of your app will get proxy creation by default unless you turn it off.&lt;/p>

    <title>The performance implications of IEnumerable vs. IQueryable</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1>The performance implications of IEnumerable vs. IQueryable&lt;/h1>
&lt;P>It all started innocently enough. I was implementing a "Older Posts/Newer Posts" feature for my new web site and was writing code like this:&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>IEnumerable&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt; FilterByCategory(IEnumerable&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt; posts, string category) {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; if( !string.IsNullOrEmpty(category) ) {&lt;BR>    return posts.Where(p =&amp;gt; p.Category.Contains(category));&lt;BR>  }&lt;BR>}&lt;BR>...&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; var posts = FilterByCategory(db.Posts, category);&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; int count = posts.Count();&lt;BR>...&lt;BR>&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>The "db" was an EF object context object, but it could just as easily been a LINQ to SQL context. Once I ran this code, it failed at run-time with a null reference exception on Category. "That's strange," I thought. "Some of my categories are null, but I expect the 'like' operation in SQL to which Contains maps to skip the null values." That should've been my first clue.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Clue #2 was when I added the null check into my Where expression and found that their were far fewer results than I expected. Some experimentation revealed that the case of the category string mattered. "Hm. That's really strange," I thought. "By default, the 'like' operation doesn't care about case." Second clue unnoticed.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>My 3rd and final clue was that even though my site was only showing a fraction of the values I knew where in the database, it had slowed to a crawl. By now, those of you experienced with LINQ to&amp;nbsp;Entities/SQL are hollering from the audience: "Don't go into the woods alone! IEnumerable kills all the benefits of IQueryable!"&lt;/P>
&lt;P>See, what I'd done was unwittingly switched from LINQ to Entities, which takes my C# expressions and translates them into SQL, and was now running LINQ to Objects, which executes my expressions directly.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>"But that can't be," I thought, getting hot under the collar (I was wearing a dress shirt that day -- the girlfriend likes me to look dapper!). "To move from LINQ to Entities/SQL to LINQ to Objects, I thought I had to be explicit and use a method like ToList() or ToArray()." Au contraire mon fraire (the girlfriend also really likes France).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Here's what I expected to be happening. If I have an expression like "db.Posts" and I execute that expression by doing a foreach, I expect the SQL produced by LINQ to Entities/SQL to look like this:&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>select * from Posts&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>If I add a Where clause, I expect the SQL to be modified:&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>select * from Posts where Category like '%whatever%'&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>Further, if I do a Count on the whole thing, e.g.&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>db.Posts.Where(p =&amp;gt; p.Contains(category)).Count()&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>I expect that to turn into the following SQL:&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>select count(*) from Posts where Category like '%whatever%'&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>And that's all true if I keep things to just "var" but I wasn't -- I was being clever and building functions to build up my queries. And because I couldn't use "var" as a function parameter, I had to pick a type. I picked the wrong one: IEnumerable.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>The problem with IEnumerable is that it doesn't have enough information to support the building up of queries. Let's take a look at the extension method of Count over an IEnumerable:&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>public static int Count&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt;(this IEnumerable&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt; source) {&lt;BR>  ...&lt;BR>  int num = 0;&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;using (IEnumerator&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt; enumerator = source.GetEnumerator()) {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; while (enumerator.MoveNext()) { num++; }&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;return num;&lt;BR>}&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>See? It's not composing the source IEnumerable over which it's operating -- it's executing the enumerator and counting the results. Further, since our example IEnumerator was a Where statement, which was in turn a accessing the list of Posts from the database, the effect was filtering in the Where over objects constituted from the following SQL:&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>select * from Posts&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>How did I see that? Well, I tried hooking up the supremely useful SQL Profiler to my ISP's database that was holding the data, but I didn't have permission. Luckily, the SQL tab in &lt;A href="http://linqpad.net">LinqPad&lt;/A> will show me what SQL is being executed and it showed me just that (or rather, the slightly more verbose and more correct SQL that LINQ to Entities generates in these circumstances).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Now, I had a problem. I didn't want to pass around IEnumerable, because clearly that's slowing things down. A lot. On the other hand, I don't want to use&amp;nbsp;ObjectSet&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt; because it doesn't compose, i.e. Where doesn't return that. What is the right interface to use to compose separate expressions into a single SQL statement? As you've probably guessed by now from the title of this post, the answer is: IQueryable.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Unlike IEnumerable, IQueryable exposes the underlying expression so that it can be composed by the caller. In fact, if you look at the IQueryable implementation of the Count extension method, you'll see something very different:&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>public static int Count&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt;(this IQueryable&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt; source) {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; ...&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; return source.Provider.Execute&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;(&lt;BR>    Expression.Call(null,&lt;BR>      ((MethodInfo) MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod()).&lt;BR>      MakeGenericMethod(&lt;BR>        new Type[] { typeof(TSource) }),&lt;BR>        new Expression[] { source.Expression }));&lt;BR>}&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>This code isn't exactly intuitive, but what's happening is that we're forming an expression which is composed of whatever expression is exposed by the IQueryable we're operating over and the Count method, which we're then implementing. To get this code path to execute for our example, we simply have to replace the use of IEnumerable with IQueryable:&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>&lt;STRONG>IQueryable&lt;/STRONG>&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt; FilterByCategory(&lt;STRONG>IQueryable&lt;/STRONG>&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt; posts, string category) {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; if( !string.IsNullOrEmpty(category) ) {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return posts.Where(p =&amp;gt; p.Category.Contains(category));&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; }&lt;BR>}&lt;BR>...&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; var posts = FilterByCategory(db.Posts, category);&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; int count = posts.Count();&lt;BR>...&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>Notice that none of the actual code changes. However, this new code runs much faster and with the case- and null-insensitivity built into the 'like' operator in SQL instead of semantics of the Contains method in LINQ to Objects.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>The way it works is that we stack one IQueryable implementation onto another, in our case Count works on the Where which works on the ObjectSet returned from the Posts property on the object context (ObjectSet itself is an IQueryable). Because each outer IQueryable is reaching into the expression exposed by the inner IQueryable, it's only the outermost one -- Count in our example -- that causes the execution (foreach would also do it, as would ToList() or ToArray()).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Using IEnumerable, I was pulling back the ~3000 posts from my blog, then filtering them on the client-side and then doing a count of that.&lt;STRONG>With IQueryable, I execute the complete query on the server-side:&lt;/STRONG>&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>select count(*) from Posts where Category like '%whatever%'&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>And, as our felon friend Ms. Stewart would say: "that's a good thing."&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>I went to a college planning sessions at my sons' high school not because I'm hung up on getting my Sophomore into a top school, but because I thought I'd get a jump on things. I learned I was actually behind.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>For one, I learned that the high school has an online system that will do some amazing things:&lt;/P>
&lt;UL>
&lt;LI>It will give my son a personality test and an interest test.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>From those tests, it will tell him what kinds of careers he might want to consider.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>Based on those careers, what major should he have.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>From the major, what schools around the country offer it.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>In those schools, what the entrance requirements are.&lt;/LI>&lt;/UL>
&lt;P>That means that my son can answer questions about personality and interests and draw a straight line through to what he needs to do to get into a school so he can learn to do the jobs he'll like and be good at. Holy cow. We didn't have anything like that when I was a kid.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Further, the online system has two complete SAT and ACT tests in it, so, along with the PSAT that he's already taking, he can do a practice ACT, figure out which test he's best at (my 34 ACT score was way better than my 1240 SATs) and just take that test, since most schools these days take both SAT or ACT results.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>This is all freely provided by the high school and, in fact, they have counseling sessions with the students at each grade level for them to get the most from this system.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>It's no wonder that 93% of students from this high school go on to 4 or 2-year college degree programs.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>That was the good part.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>The scary part is that my eldest, half way through his Sophomore year, is essentially half-way through his high school career. Colleges only see their grades through the end of Junior year, since most college applications are due in the middle of January of their Senior year at the latest. I have to sit down with my son and have the conversation about how "even if you get a 4.0 from now on, the best grades you can have are..."&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Is it just me or is the world moving faster with each passing day?&lt;/P></content>
