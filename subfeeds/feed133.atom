&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/drm.aspx">Here&lt;/a>. The last time I saw a movie, it occurred to me that as much as I love them, I hate theaters. They overcharge for the tickets and then require your first born child for popcorn and sodas. Movie theaters make airports seem like dollar stores.

Anyway, I've got a great setup at home, complete with big screen TV, 5.1 digital surround sound and a PC already connected to the whole mess. I'm a big NetFlix.com fan, but they and sites like CinemaNow.com only show stuff that's available for rental. I want first run movies!

Shouldn't a platform with such a strong media and digital rights management story allow me to watch first run movies at my house? And wouldn't that be a killer app for a new OS from that company?

DISCLAIMER: I'm not pre-announcing anything. I don't know of any plans along these lines; I just think it'd be cool.</content>

&lt;p>Sorry for the long wait. There's been two whole books written between the last release of Genghis and &lt;a href="/public/tools/genghis">this one&lt;/a>. Here's the list of new features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>Everything works under .NET 1.0 and 1.1 (except HandleCollector)&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>MSN Messanger-style popup window&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>UI Type Editor for use with ImageList index selection&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>AppBar implementation&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Text file search&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Themed controls&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Single instance application support, including passing command line args from other instances&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Multiple top-level window support&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Many enhancements and fixes to the command line parser&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Splash screen class&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Improved WebCommandLineHelper class which now works with .NET 1.0 and 1.1, includes URL decoding and requires no additional permissions (although it does require a server-side HTTP handler, included as the ConfigFileHandler class that maps requests for foo.exe?bar=quux.config to the foo.exe.config file)&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>WizardSheet updates&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Status Bar Extender for mapping status messages to Windows Forms controls&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Thanks to my new build master, Mike Marshal, who got all of this together. He's the greatest!&lt;/p>
