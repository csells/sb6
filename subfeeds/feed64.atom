&lt;P>Another thing that Joe loves is that a Avalon designer's work is in the same format as what the designer needs and can be dropped right into an app w/o converting from bitmap mock-ups (&lt;A href="http://www.petersterndesign.com/longhorn.htm">Peter Stern and I are doing this&lt;/A>).&lt;/P>

&lt;P>You can read about the work that Joe has done with XAML and download his code samples on his web site's &lt;A href="http://www.joemarini.com/tutorials/index.php">tutorial section&lt;/A>. Joe is definitely one to watch in the Longhorn/Avalon space.&lt;/P></content>

	on letting a midget live up there? Because I think that if you are going to 
	let a midget live in the house, they have a right to have a room with a 
	window or something. In that case, you should have them move into the 
	cupboard under the counter in the laundry room and we can knock out a space 
	for a window. It would also be a lot easier for them to get to without 
	having to rig up some sort of ladder, as that would just take up more of 
	your precious space. On the other hand, living above the fridge would give 
	them easy access to the food, and we could have a string with a roll up 
	ladder rigging. Although having easier access to the fridge may make them 
	over eat and they may get wedged up in the space over the fridge, be unable 
	to escape and then we will have to explain why we have that strange odor in 
	the kitchen. &lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=19171">
part 3&lt;/a>). It's not an actual interview, but Gretchen Ledgard and Zoe Goldring, 
both Central Sourcing Consultants at HR for MS, lead you through what to expect 
at a Microsoft interview, providing a wealth of wonderful tips, e.g.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>MS is casual, so it doesn't matter so much what you where (i.e. don't 
	feel you have to wear a suit, but don't show up in flip-flops and headphones 
	around your neck [still playing!]). Regardless of what you where, it's 
	what's in your head that's important.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Interact a lot of with the interviewer. Ask questions, think out loud, 
	etc. The questions are meant to be vague and again, it's about what's going 
	on in your head, so verbalize it.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Bring water if you're thirsty, not coffee, as spilling coffee is going 
	to leave a much more lasting stain/impression.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>MS rarely asks logic/riddle questions anymore. They're not a good 
	indicator of a good employee.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Expect coding questions if you're a dev, testing questions if you're a 
	tester and passion questions no matter what.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>If an MS recruiter calls, don't expect them to have a specific job in 
	mind. Instead, expect to be asked what you'd like to do at MS.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>If the first interview doesn't take, it may well be that you're right 
	for MS but not right for that job. It can literally take &lt;i>years&lt;/i> to 
	find the right job for you at MS.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>BTW, I have to say that I never got a ride on an HR shuttle. I guess they 
save that for the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; hires... : )&lt;/p>
