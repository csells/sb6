&lt;P>It's very easy, as the PM, to not want to waste team time in a meeting, letting folks go when there's still 30 minutes left. In fact, lots of folks will praise you for your short meetings. That's fine if all of the work for that meeting has been done, e.g. everyone's reported their status, all of the open questions have been decided, etc.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>However, it's often the case that in these meetings, other issues will come up to be discussed in future meetings to be scheduled at another time. Don't let your concern for your team mates' free time tempt you to let 'em go! It's hard enough to get the folks you need together in a room. Once you've got 'em there, use 'em.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>For example, if you've got the team together for weekly status that's scheduled for 60 minutes, it often only takes 30 minutes. In that 30 minutes, you may decide that a subset of the team needs to get together for an hour design discussion on whether to spinning text boxes to your next software project. As &lt;A href="/1943">a dutiful PM (aka "mom")&lt;/A>, you'll often find yourself saying, "Sure -- I'll set that up." Then it's your job to find an hour on everyone's calendar while that issue remains open and the project drags on.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Don't do it! Instead, peel off the folks in the status meeting that need to be in the "hour design discussion" and have the meeting right then and there. You've already scheduled the weekly status for 60 minutes, so you know those folks are free and just dying to get back to reading email in piece in their office -- put 'em to work instead! Who the hell knows how long a design discussion is going to take anyway? It's just as likely to go under an hour as over, so you might be able to wrap up the issue right then and there, skipping the need for another meeting altogether. Believe me, your team mates will thank you for that!&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>I was building some code to access Index Server's results via .NET and I got this:&lt;/P>
&lt;P>// Catalog specified in connection string&lt;BR>string query = "select Path from Scope() where FREETEXT('foo')";&lt;BR>using( OleDbConnection conn = new OleDbConnection("Provider=MSIDXS.1;Data Source=MyCatalog") ) {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; conn.Open();&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; OleDbDataAdapter cmd = new OleDbDataAdapter(query, conn);&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; DataSet ds = new DataSet();&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; cmd.Fill(ds, "SearchResults");&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; DataTable table = ds.Tables[0];&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; ds.Tables.Remove(table);&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; return table;&lt;BR>}&lt;/P>
&lt;P>This came from a combo of stuff I found on the net and my own experimenting. However, I had to get an MS employee who know IS (thanks Chad Ray!) to figure out how to access IS remotely, which I was finally able to get working thusly:&lt;/P>
&lt;P>// Server and catalog specified in query string, not connection string&lt;BR>string query = "select Path from MyServer.MyCatalog..Scope() where FREETEXT('foo')";&lt;BR>using( OleDbConnection conn = new OleDbConnection("Provider=MSIDXS.1") ) {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; conn.Open();&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; OleDbDataAdapter cmd = new OleDbDataAdapter(query, conn);&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; DataSet ds = new DataSet();&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; cmd.Fill(ds, "SearchResults");&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; DataTable table = ds.Tables[0];&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; ds.Tables.Remove(table);&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; return table;&lt;BR>}&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Also, if the server or catalog name has anything "weird" in it, e.g. those wacky dashes, you're supposed to wrap it in double quotes. My experimenting showed that wrapping any server or catalog name in double quotes worked just fine, e.g.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>string query = "select Path from \"MyServer\".\"MyCatalog\"..Scope() where FREETEXT('foo')";&lt;/P>
&lt;P>However, if the server name is "localhost" or "127.0.0.1", IS doesn't like it, which meant that I had to check for those server names and drop the ones that used the loopback adapter (although using the machine name of the local machine worked just fine), e.g.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>static bool IsLocalHost(string server) {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; return string.IsNullOrEmpty(server) || (string.Compare(server, "localhost", true) == 0) || (string.Compare(server, "127.0.0.1") == 0);&lt;BR>}&lt;/P>
&lt;P>string GetPlainTextQueryString(string text, string columns) {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; // IS doesn't like "localhost"&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; if( IsLocalHost(_server) ) {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return string.Format("select {0} from \"{1}\"..Scope() where FREETEXT('{2}')", columns, _catalog, text);&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; }&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; else {&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; return string.Format("select {0} from \"{1}\".\"{2}\"..Scope() where FREETEXT('{3}')", columns, _server, _catalog, text);&lt;BR>&amp;nbsp; }&lt;BR>}&lt;/P>

My understanding is that, unlike CDs and DVDs, which are easy to read via computer, books are not, so I'll need a service where I can box up my books and send 'em for ripping, resulting in a shiny DVD filled with my words and images, ideally OCR'd enough to allow full text search. In fact, after a while, the book rip houses would have most books on file, so I'd only have to prove that I own a book and they could email me the electronic version, saving us both the shipping charges. In further fact, this is an additional service that Google and/or Amazon could provide, since they're already "ripping" the books they sell...&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>The one thing I don't hate about books is the content. That part triggers my thoughts and my emotions in me that are so strong, I put up with all the things I hate so I can get to it.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Why isn't there an iPod for books (is it because iBook is already taken)? Why isn't all print media, e.g. novels, poems, comic books, news papers, magazines, etc, available in electronic format?&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>In an ideal world, a PM would be able to get together with their team, lead the discussion 'til everyone agrees what they're going to do and while they're doing it, hang out on the beach answering the odd question on their smart phone 'til the work is scheduled to be done.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>At Microsoft, we don't live in an ideal world.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Instead, we have roving bands of PMs prowling the halls looking for resources, trying to get things done. Because this is an accepted part of MS culture, people actually listen when a PM shows up at their door to pitch their idea and ask them to help. And, so long as it fits into the broad goals they've set up with their boss and their other commitments, and it's more fun then the thing they're supposed to be doing, they often say "yes."&lt;/P>
&lt;P>This means that folks on your team often have multiple commitments that they have to decide between. It's like when you get married or close friends, you're going to have more than one family to visit at Christmas time. However, you have to put your blood relatives first, making them your top priority and squeezing in the other families when you can, e.g. Christmas Eve Eve.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>As a PM, you have to know what the "blood relationships" are for each of your team members. Are you their second or third family? If so, you have to take "Christmas as celebrated on." However, if they're in your first family, then you take top priority and you should feel free to act like their mom.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Traditionally, it's the mom's job to make sure people are healthy and happy (doing stuff they like), making sure that they're eating right (getting pizza during late night coding sessions) and that they're getting special treats when they deserve them (public announcements praising their work).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Likewise, it's the mom's job to remind them of their chores (their task list), check their report card (make sure their tasks are up to the quality bar) and to guilt them when they forget Mother's Day (keeping up with the schedule).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>As the PM, you're the team's memory, the catch-all for crappy tasks nobody else wants to do and the one that makes sure everyone is working well together. You're the glue and the conscience. If the teammates on your team aren't waking up thinking of tasks &lt;EM>you&lt;/EM> want done and going to bed hoping they're making good progress on &lt;EM>your &lt;/EM>tasks, then, according to MS culture, that's your fault.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>So, make sure folks are unblocked and happy, but also make sure they're doing what you consider their top priority and that they're doing it right and one time. Trust that they're doing what they should be, but make sure they know what you think they should be doing and that they're doing it right.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>The downside is that such a world doesn't scale without PMs at every level, but that's why MS has PMs, Lead PMs, Group PMs and Product Unit Managers, all of them acting as the mom for their families.&lt;/P></content>
