&lt;h2>&lt;i>Midnight to Midnight, August 30th, 2002&lt;/i>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Brad Abrams, Lead Program Manager on the Microsoft .NET Framework team, said 
something that inspired me the other day. He was being broadcast along with 
Chris Andersen (another lead PM) on The .NET Show on the topic of
&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/Episode026/default.asp">
Understanding the Framework&lt;/a>. Brad and Scott spent almost the entire show 
talking about how &lt;b>the various benefits of .NET&lt;/b>, e.g. productivity, 
reliability, security, backwards compatibility with Win32 and COM, being able to 
recompile your C++ code in managed mode to use and expose .NET components 
without changing any of the code or losing noticeable efficiency (apparently 
they didn't ship until they could do this with Word), the consistency and 
universality of the Framework Class Libraries, and on and on, &lt;b>all &lt;i>without
&lt;/i>mentioning &amp;quot;web services.&amp;quot;&lt;/b> He did say that .NET was hands down the best 
platform for doing web services, but even if you're not doing web services, &lt;b>
.NET enhances your programming experience across the board&lt;/b> &lt;b>for the 
existing kinds of applications and components that you're developing now&lt;/b>. 
Normally I'm not into this kind of hyperbole, but in this case, I absolutely 
agree with Brad and wish that Microsoft would push these features for things 
you're doing right now as well as web services for the future. Microsoft, in 
their interminable marketing wisdom, has completely undersold the rest of .NET, 
at the expense of &lt;b>developers the world over, still stuck in the old unmanaged 
world&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in the spirit of freedom and happiness for developers everywhere, &lt;b>I 
hereby declare Friday, August 30th to be International, Pan-Galactic, 
Cross-Universe &amp;quot;Spend A Day with .NET&amp;quot; Day&lt;/b>. On that day, I'm calling for all 
developers everywhere to spend up to 24-hours, midnight to midnight, building a 
.NET application of some kind or another. I don't care if you have to bootleg a 
copy of VS.NET from your friend or download
&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/000/976/msdncompositedoc.xml">
the freely available .NET Framework SDK&lt;/a> and write your code while you 
pretend to work, lie to your boss or take a sick day, but &lt;b>I want developers 
around the globe to spend all day doing nothing but writing &lt;i>something &lt;/i>in 
.NET&lt;/b>. It can be absolutely anything, e.g. web site, web service, NT service, 
component, control, VS.NET add-in, shell extension, game, utility, graphics 
demo, etc, so long as you build it with .NET. Feel free to spend from now until 
then researching .NET with any number of books, articles, whitepapers, 
conferences, mailing lists, bits of online documentation, sample projects, 3rd 
party components, etc, but all .NET code must written on August 30th. And then 
when you're done at 11:59pm, I want you to &lt;b>send me what you built and my team 
of judges will decide who's deserves &lt;i>the prizes&lt;/i>&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1>&lt;a name="prizes">The Prizes&lt;/a> &lt;i>(updated!)&lt;/i>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In the spirit of one of the many things that .NET does very well, the &lt;b>
Grand Prize is a free pass to &lt;a href="/conference">the Web Services DevCon&lt;/a>&lt;/b>. 
These are the other prizes, in no particular order, based on what I have at my 
immediate disposal to offer. If anyone would like to

  &lt;li>Whatever else I can think up between now and August 30th. : )&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1>The Rules&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
  &lt;li>Thou shall sign &lt;a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/agreement.htm">this agreement&lt;/a> before 
  submission. In a nutshell, it says that you own the code you're submitting, 
  that you wrote it in a 24-hour period on August 30th and that you won't sue me 
  over it.&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>Thou may use existing unmanaged code via MC++ &amp;quot;IJW&amp;quot; (It Just Works) 
  technology or via Win32 or COM interop, but the lines of unmanaged code may 
  consist of no more than 49% of the total lines of code in the submission.&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>Thou may use 3rd party libraries.&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>Thou may work in teams, but prizes may need to be split between 
  submitters.&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>Thou shall include instructions for building and exercising your 
  submission simple enough that even our judges can follow them. A description 
  of why your code is cool is highly recommended.&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>Thou shall check these rules again before making your submission in case I 
  think of any more (engineers are tricky).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1>The Judging Criteria&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>So long as the rules are met, the judges are looking strictly for &lt;b>the 
completely subjective &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; factor&lt;/b>. Any time you can &lt;b>make a judge say 
&amp;quot;wow,&amp;quot;&lt;/b> or &amp;quot;I didn't know you can do that in .NET,&amp;quot; that's good. If you do 
decide to use existing unmanaged code or 3rd party libraries, the added 
functionality of your code should outshine the functionality of the code you 
didn't write, or you will be judged accordingly. If there is some doubt that you 
actually wrote the code in the single 24-hour period of August 30th, the judges 
may ask for further confirmation and will need to be convinced, e.g. &lt;b>don't 
send a managed word processor including hyphenation rules unless you've got a 
signed affidavit from a notary&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1>The Submission&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you're
&lt;a href="mailto:submission@sellsbrothers.com?subject=I'm planning a Spend A Day With .NET Submission">
planning to send in a submission, please let me know&lt;/a>. This helps me to 
arrange prizes, judges, etc. &lt;b>The community response has been overwhelming, 
with lots of blog coverage of this event, along with lots of prize donations.&lt;/b> 
So far, I've gotten about a dozen folks promising submissions that represent 
individuals or teams. Some have even been from within Microsoft, so submissions 
should be pretty cool (I guess even guys inside of MS don't get enough coding 
time : ).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At 11:59pm on August 30th,
&lt;a href="mailto:submission@sellsbrothers.com?subject=Spend A Day With .NET Submission">send me an URL to your submission, including full source&lt;/a>. 
If you have a prize preference along with whether you mind me posting your 
source on my site or not. At the very least, I'd like to host the binaries for 
the winners on my site so that visitors can see what .NET can really do in just 
a day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1>The Rest&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you've got any questions or comments or you'd like to sponsor this event 
or send along a prize or whatever,
&lt;a href="mailto:csells@sellsbrothers.com?subject=Re: Spend A Day With .NET">drop
