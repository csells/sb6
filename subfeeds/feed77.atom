    <content type="html">&lt;h1>"Down-to-Earth Marketing"&lt;/h1>
&lt;P>In &lt;A href="http://dotnetjunkies.net/WebLog/BsBlog/archive/2004/05/07/13066.aspx">a recent post&lt;/A>, Brendan Tompkins describes &lt;A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=5219#5219">one of my recent Channel9 videos&lt;/A> as "down-to-earth marketing." On the one hand, I find that&amp;nbsp;ironic, as that particular video is me talking about the chaos that is MS culture and wondering how we get anything done at all, so if that makes you want to come then you belong here, Brendan. : )&lt;/P>
&lt;P>On the other hand, at MSDN we realize that &lt;EM>we're all in marketing&lt;/EM>. In fact, any individial or organization whose job it is to talk with customers is in marketing. The particular brand of marketing we use at MSDN is "not marketing," i.e. we package up the most technical, straight-forward information we can and get it into the hands of developers so that they can be successful using our platforms. Of course, the desired result is that more developers build most stuff on our platforms that causes more folks to purchase our platforms, which is why it's a marketing function.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Thinking of it as marketing is helpful, as it focuses me on what I've determined as job #1 in marketing: never say anything bad about your products that doesn't have a solution. For example, recently I was giving a talk at &lt;A href="http://www.corillian.com/">Corillian&lt;/A>&amp;nbsp;(&lt;A href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman&lt;/A>'s day job) and I was very free with the problems in Windows XP (which is really just a keep trick to get the audience to like me), &lt;EM>but only because I was pitching Longhorn as the solution to all of those problems&lt;/EM> (and, of course, the cause of no new problems : ). On the other hand, if I had focused on the problems of Windows XP without being right there with a proposed solution to this problems, not only would my talk have tanked (who likes to hear problems w/ no solutions?), but it would have been counter to the purpose of my job: driving customers to our products.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>So, am I a technologist? I like to think so. Am I engaged in the down-to-earth marketing that Brendan prefers? Absolutely. And good eye, Brandan!&lt;/P></content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1>Longhorn M7.2 Bits Coming to MSDN Subscribers&lt;/h1>
&lt;a href="http://msdn.com/longhorn">Here&lt;/a>. &lt;P>In case you've heard the rumors about a new drop of Longhorn coming to WinHEC attendees, you've heard right. The Milestone 7.2 (M7.2) drop of Longhorn will be given to WinHEC attendees this week and will be available to MSDN Subscribers for download RSN*. The plan is to provide regular LH Milestone drops to the community as we have them, regardless of whether they really provide more functionality/stability or not. That way, we keep you guys in synch with what we're doing and &lt;A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/community/newsgroups/default.aspx">you can give us more relevant feedback&lt;/A>.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>In M7.2, the big deal is the addition of 3D support in Avalon, including declarative support in XAML. There are better things coming in 3D (as there are in the whole of Longhorn), but this is the initial set of functionality and &lt;A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.windows.developer.winfx.avalon">we'd love to know what you think&lt;/A>.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>To set your expectations properly, WinHEC attendees and MSDN Subscribers will have access to the M7.2 OS and SDK bits, but will not have access to any matching Visual Studio bits. &lt;STRONG>&lt;EM>&lt;FONT color=#ff0000>Neither the PDC Visual Studio installation nor the latest Visual Studio 2005 community drop nor even the upcoming Visual Studio 2005 beta will install or run properly on M7.2 Longhorn.&lt;/FONT>&lt;/EM>&lt;/STRONG> We're hoping for future LH Milestone drops to include the matching Visual Studio bits, but this one doesn't. Luckily, MSBuild is included along with the compilers, so you can still build LH code under M7.2 like the pioneers did when they were blazing the Oregon Trail. It'll put hair on your chest and build strong bones and teeth.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>* RSN == Real Soon Now&lt;/P></content>
