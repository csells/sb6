Sometimes I write something on my spout and it gets a ton of comments on my little homegrown message board (built by The .NET Guy himself [1]). More often, I hear almost nothing at all. But sometimes I get email and IMs from all corners of the globe from folks that want to give me feedback but don't want to post publicly for some reason.

This last thing is what happened on my "The real goals of marketing?" piece [2]. I got some agreement w/ my friend ("Yep, marketing guys are scum. That's what they're paid for."), but mostly I got all kinds of folks, marketers and not, saying that my naive view is the favored one.

John Porcaro was a rare one that actually put his feelings on the subject up for the public and sums up most of the feedback I got. Plus, he's a Group Manager @ MS's Home and Entertainment division, so hopefully he's so impressed with my posts that he'll want to send me an MCE PC. I canâ€™t be bought, John, but I can be rented. : )

I found the original C implementation (which can still compile for 16 or 32 bits!) and hers, the very nicely done WinForms version (from scratch!). Christine's implementation is not quite perfect yet, but it's very, very close.

I did some coding on it and then talked her into opening the source up in a GotDotNet Workspace. The project has two goals:

1. Perfectly recreating sol.exe in managed code
2. Separating the UI completely from the data

The 1st goal is to provide homage to the world's most popular Windows application (!), although I've already violated it while keeping to the spirit (Undo needs a Ctrl+Z mapping!).

The 2nd goal is to enable other UIs to be placed on top of the sol.exe data model for future versions of Windows which may or may not have amazing new UI capabilities (and which may or may not be discussed in glowing details at the PDC [1]) and about which I may or may not be writing about in the future (vague enough? : ).

Got some time? Instead of firing up the existing sol.exe, help us finish our .NET version!
