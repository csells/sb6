&lt;P>However, if you're doing anything fancy, like specifying an access key, you can do this using the dotted element name syntax:&lt;/P>&lt;PRE>&lt;FONT size=2>&amp;lt;MenuItem&amp;gt;&lt;BR>&lt;STRONG>&lt;SPAN>&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;MenuItem.Header&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/STRONG>&lt;/FONT>&lt;B>&lt;BR>&lt;FONT size=2>&lt;STRONG>&lt;SPAN>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;FlowPanel&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/STRONG>&lt;BR>&lt;STRONG>&lt;SPAN>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;AccessKey Key="N" /&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/STRONG>&lt;BR>&lt;STRONG>&lt;SPAN>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;SimpleText&amp;gt;ew&amp;lt;/SimpleText&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/STRONG>&lt;BR>&lt;STRONG>&lt;SPAN>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/FlowPanel&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/STRONG>&lt;BR>&lt;STRONG>&lt;SPAN>&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/MenuItem.Header&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/STRONG>&lt;BR>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/B>&lt;FONT size=2>&amp;lt;/MenuItem&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT>&lt;/PRE>
&lt;P>In the first case, we're just specifying a string, so declaring the Header attribute inline makes sense. In the second case, we're composing the Header for the MenuItem as a FlowPanel, combining an AccessKey and a SimpleText element. Underneath the covers, XAML attributes translate into properties, so for those properties more complicated than strings, the dotted element name syntax allows properties to be specified as sub-elements.&lt;/P></content>

He recommended &lt;A href="http://www.revjon.com/ftb/">the FreeTextBox ASP.NET control&lt;/A> and this thing rocks! The Word/FrontPage keystrokes work the way I want them to. The Styles and Fonts and Colors are all provided for in an Office 2003-like toolbar. There's a spell-checker (that installs on the fly, no less!), raw HTML editing, a table editor and a function that cleans up Word-produced HTML better than FrontPage! Plus it only took me about 30 minutes to get the thing going from a standing start and that included moving a form to use post-back so that I could enable runat=server. The only things I haven't figured out how to make it do are disable some of the toolbar items, allow tab to take me out of the editor to other controls on my form and set the target on a link, but still, not bad for 30 minutes. : )&lt;/P>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1>Learning to Learn, Part II&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>
Tony R. Kuphaldt, an instructor at Bellingham Technical College in Washington 
recently emailed me that &lt;a href="#Learning_to_Learn">my Learning to Learn piece&lt;/a> 
spoke to him and pointed me to &lt;a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/books/socratic/">
his web site&lt;/a> where he provides &lt;a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/books/socratic/doc/lett0045.pdf">
a wonderful look at his own experiences in self-teaching&lt;/a>. In this paper, 
Tony describes his insights, starting with an amazing look into my own previous 
field of employ:&lt;br>&lt;blockquote>&amp;quot;Industry training, at least in its popular 
	form, is roughly based on the model of a fire hydrant: sit in front of it, 
	open the valve, and take a big drink. Due to time limitations, trainers 
	present information at a rapid pace, with participants retaining only a 
	fraction of what they see and hear. What knowledge they do gain seldom 
	passes on to co-workers after the training session, and is forgotten almost 
	as rapidly as it is presented, necessitating continual re-training. ... 
	[Students] often leave with the impression of the instructor being something 
	of a genius for being able to present so much information so quickly, and 
	instilling within their own minds a sense of inferiority for not grasping 
	all of it at the delivered pace.&amp;quot;&lt;br>&lt;/blockquote>Further, Tony describes 
the technique I use to really learn something:&lt;br>&lt;blockquote>&amp;quot;What did I do to 
	learn? Simple: I would challenge my existing knowledge of a subject by 
	trying to apply it to real-world conditions and/or thought experiments. If I 
	didn't know enough about a topic to successfully apply it to a realistic 
	problem, I would research and study until I did. If ever I was completely 
	baffled by a problem, I could determine my own conceptual weaknesses by 
	incrementally simplifying the problem until I could solve it. Whatever 
	complexity I eliminated from the problem that enabled me to solve it was 
	where my understanding was weak.  Once I knew what I didn't know, I not 
	only knew where to focus my study efforts, but I also felt more motivated to 
	study because I could perceive my own needs.&amp;quot;&lt;br>&lt;/blockquote>Tony 
characterizes his (and my) self-teaching technique as an internal feedback loop, 
where the student knows what he doesn't know. This is as opposed to an external 
feedback loop in an instructional setting, where the instructor knows what the 
student doesn't know, but the feedback loop is broken between the student and 
the instructor.&lt;/p>&lt;p>And as if that weren't enough, Tony takes his goals on the 
road, as it were, testing a self-teaching-based curriculum on his students and 
reporting on his results. I find his work especially interesting not because I 
feel the need to teach the world to teach themselves; I'm perfectly happy to 
encourage folks to learn to learn, but to have them choose other techniques. 
However, I do feel very strongly that the Sells brothers learn to learn. I can't 
imagine sending them out into the world without a firm grasp of the ability to 
teach themselves. I don't know how to do that, though, unless I start home 
schooling them. That wouldn't be out of the question except for this unhealthy 
addiction I have to a steady income stream...&lt;/p>
