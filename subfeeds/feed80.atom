this evening's Portland Nerd Dinner&lt;/a> (you didn't pass up a chance to meet 
Ward Cunningham, did you?), I'm thinking there's one step in the middle (at 
least : ).&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">So, picture the scene. After hearing about a guy 
that has a &amp;quot;fob&amp;quot; on which he has to enter a password to get a 6-digit number 
that changes every 60 seconds to that he could log into his company's VPN, 
declaring that that's what happens when you let &lt;a href="http://www.develop.com/kbrown/">
Keith Brown&lt;/a> run the world (I love you, man : ), and describing the CSSM (the 
Chris Sells Security Model -- which I can not only implement under .NET, but 
actually apply to code [maybe I'll start a workspace...]), I turned to Ward and 
asked him the same question that I had asked the group from the last PND, i.e. 
&amp;quot;What's the next big leap away in development?&amp;quot;, being careful not to give him 
my thinking from last time.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">Ward went a whole other way.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">
And he got me thinking it's a good idea.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">So, Ward starts 
describing how to use loose typing (as in computer science &amp;quot;types&amp;quot; &lt;b>&lt;i>and&lt;/i>&lt;/b> 
what you do with your 101-Key Text Wizard) and TDD-style tests to infer types 
for your loose typing and I'm shaking my head, 'cuz I still gotta write the 
code.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">Then a long-haired guy to my left who's name I never 
lernt (I meant to!), starts talking about how each leap in the past came from 
handling one detail that you don't care about, e.g. register allocation, memory 
management, etc, and I think that has the possibility of helping me, 'cept the 
thing I want to get rid of is the code (I mean, if I can't make a business on 
generating the stuff, then let's kill it altogether : ).&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">Then 
Jim Blizzard starts asking an interesting line of questions about whether a leap 
is really a leap 'til we're passed it and we can look back and decide it was a 
leap. While I think a leap is a leap because you can feel it (I can still 
remember the joy of my first program [leap 1], hear the ping in my head when I 
understood OO [leap 2] and feel the rush in my veins when I got managed 
programming [leap 3]), I was very interested in Jim's point because I think he 
was leading me somewhere [leap 4?].&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">Then, Ward jumped in 
again with another scenario where you start from nothing and have a programmer 
at your elbow to translate the next thing you want as you desire it (the first 
such scenario was Ward's Adventure Diet where you start with nothing, then add 
one kind of food/day 'til you pass the unit tests I guess [Ward actually put 
himself on this diet for a while -- man, we &lt;i>&lt;b>are &lt;/b>&lt;/i>nerds]) and that's 
when I nearly leap across the table so that I can get my own words in edgewise, 
literally telling Warm that he had to stop talking now so that I could.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">
Because that's when it all hit me.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">What I want is &lt;a href="http://www.x1.com">
X1&lt;/a> for programs. I've fallen in love with X1 because it gives me immediate 
gratification. It still finds the same things that Outlook search and Explorer 
Search finds for me, but X1 does it in such real time that I can narrow in 
several fields at once based on what I know about what I'm looking for, e.g. 
some of the body content and/or who it's from and/or what folder it's filed in 
and/or when I got it, etc, until I see a small number of choices from which to 
pick and I can click on one and say &amp;quot;aha! that's the one!&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">I 
want X1 for programs. I want to start with nothing and keep refining it with 
commands like, &amp;quot;I want an app,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I want a grid&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the data should come from 
here&amp;quot; and have my computer say, &amp;quot;Would you like an app like this, this or this&amp;quot; 
and &amp;quot;would you like the grid to look like this, this or this.&amp;quot; And I want my 
computer to know about every feature that ever been built into 3 or more 
programs, e.g. from remembering the spot my window was the app last ran to 
dropping in pivot tables, from reading/writing to/from databases to providing 
theming. Anything that doesn't work in 3-6 choices, e.g. color themes do but 
individual colors don't, I want a Property Browser/Windows Forms Designer-like 
experience and only when I get to implementing something that hasn't already 
been implemented 3 times do I even want to think about writing a line of code.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">
'cuz here's the thing. I don't want to give up writing code. I love writing 
code. I just hate writing code that's already been written. What I want is for a 
customer to go through all of the stuff in the Codeless, Human-enabled, Realtime, 
Interactive System (or CHRIS*, if you will : ) as described in the previous 
paragraph, get to an actual working system except that it doesn't do some cool, 
unique thing that no one's ever thought of before and then send it to me in an 
email along with a PO for how much they're willing to pay for me to do the last 
bit.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">When the last bit's been written 2 more times, it goes 
into the CHRIS and around we go again.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">And I was all happy 
with that answer and I presented it the PND crowd just before the Sells Brothers 
(who had come along and been absolute &lt;b>&lt;i>angels&lt;/i>&lt;/b> for more than 2 hours 
while I geeked out with my friends), lost it and started throwing their shoes at 
each other in the Washington Square Mall food court, at which point I had to 
leave, before hearing what Jim's point was or what Ward was going to say after 
he said, &amp;quot;OK, wait, what about this...&amp;quot; which is usually what he says just 
before he tells you that he's already built what he's been warming up to for the 
last 30 minutes and you find that it rocks.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">So, you guys damn 
well better tell me what happened after I left, especially if it's better then 
the CHRIS!&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">BTW, why isn't anyone filming these PNDs? They're 
the best techie conversations I have all month...&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">&lt;a href="/1280">
Discuss&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">* I swear that 90% of that acronym 
(abbreviation?) came out naturally and was only tweaked slightly at the end for 
marketing appeal. : )&lt;/p>
