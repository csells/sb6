&lt;p align="left">&lt;i>
Monday, &lt;span class="created">June 7, 2004&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">Wednesday was a good day. Not only 
did I get birthday wishes from all over the internet (thank you, Orkut), but I 
got to give my first presentation to a Distinguished Engineer (or DE, as we call 
them in humble tones). A DE is the top end of the individual contributor ladder 
that technical folks who want to stay technical -- aka avoid becoming management 
-- are on. Architects, e.g. Don, are one step down on that ladder and Program 
Managers (PMs), e.g. me, are even further down. In this case, the DE to whom I 
was presenting is someone that I've long respected and who invented and 
continues to guide my favorite programming language: Anders Hejlsberg.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">
A couple of weeks ago, Anders was digging through our docs on a topic in which 
he was interested because of the future directions he's got in mind for C#. 
However, the particular information that Anders was looking for wasn't in our 
documentation. So, he mentioned that he'd like someone to look into it and get 
the information for him. As a percentage of the 56K employees at MS, there are a 
very few DEs, so when one of them mentions that they'd like to see something 
done, that's what happens. This doesn't happens because a DE is your boss or 
because they decide whether you get a raise or not. This happens because smart 
technical folks get respect at MS and the smarter you are, the more respect you 
get. So, when Anders mentioned to BradA that he would like a brief on this 
technology, Brad found someone to give that brief: me.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">Why 
me? Well, lately I've been talking to Brad about me doing some more technical 
work on WinFX and Longhorn. In the past, I've written and spoken a great deal 
about the good and the bad of various technologies and my thinking was that if I 
could get into a feedback loop with the product teams so that I could &lt;i>help &lt;/i>
prevent some the worse bits from making it out the door, giving me the 
opportunity to write only nice things about our technologies. Brad already runs 
the WinFX review team that's in charge of making WinFX a nice place for 
developers to play, so when I volunteered to help with some of that work, it 
didn't take long for him to take me up on it. And, after a few moments of 
hesitation when I realized that I only knew a little more than Anders about this 
particular topic, I jumped at it, digging into the technology, sending &amp;quot;tell me 
more&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;review these slides, please&amp;quot; emails to the various product groups in 
charge of those technologies (it's amazing how quickly you get a response when 
you put &amp;quot;I'm writing a presentation on your technology for Anders and...&amp;quot; into 
an email : ), revised the slides, woke up in the middle of the night with the 
perfect set of pictures to illustrate things, etc. In short, it was a blast and 
I learned a ton (which &lt;a href="#Strengths_and_Weaknesses">you know I like&lt;/a> : 
).&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">And the actual presentation was even more fun than the 
preparation. There are three kinds of talks. One kind of talk, which happens 80% 
of the time, is the kind of talk that doesn't really affect you one way or the 
other. It kind of blends in with all of the other talks you've given and doesn't 
really make an impact on you.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">One kind of talk drains you 
completely. This is the talk where you just can't get anyone to notice you at 
the front of the room and you pour all of your energy into it to make it 
acceptable at all.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">And one kind of talk, my favorite, is when 
the juices are really flowing and you walk out of the meeting all excited and 
energized. This is the kind of talk that drives me and my colleagues to 
all-night diners for a debrief session. This last talk was the kind that I had 
this time with Anders and a couple of the product teams from around the company. 
I was really just guiding the discussion, with Anders leading and peppering all 
of us with wonderful, insightful questions. I had 20+ slides with overview, 
pictures, details and recommendations, but I only showed 4 of them (3 of 
pictures and 1 of recommendations). My inability to get through all of the 
slides didn't matter: Anders got it all. He was interested in some of what I had 
to say, but also brought up points I'd never considered. What I think should be 
in our platform was changed by just listening to Anders ask questions. I could 
feel the synapses in my brain realign. It was amazing.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">Things 
will absolutely change in our platform because of the desires that Anders 
expressed during my presentation. What a privilege.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">&lt;a href="/1388">

    <summary>Here. I was recently asked to characterize the attendees of a typical DevCon and this is what I said: The attendees of a DevCon are the top of the pyramid developers that not only try new things all the time, but also make design and architecture decisions for their employers and customers. Also, all of the speakers, i.e. experts in their fields, practitioners, vendor architects, etc, are also attendees, and it's wonderful to&amp;nbsp;see them heckling each other.

&lt;a href="/conference">Here&lt;/a>. &lt;P>I was recently asked to characterize the attendees of a typical DevCon and this is what I said:&lt;/P>
&lt;P>The attendees of a DevCon are the top of the pyramid developers that not only try new things all the time, but also make design and architecture decisions for their employers and customers. Also, all of the speakers, i.e. experts in their fields, practitioners, vendor architects, etc, are also attendees, and it's wonderful to&amp;nbsp;see them heckling each other.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>The environment of a DevCon is one big room with everyone in it, so it's a shared experience front-to-back. As soon as any talk is over (I keep them at 45 minutes to get the maximum number of new ideas into people&amp;#8217;s heads), the buzz between people starts and only stops when I introduce the next speaker (loudly : ).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>A DevCon is a wonderful mix of movers and shakers, vendors, enthusiasts, architects, practitioners and and a conference with an atmosphere and a set of attendees unlike any other that I've attended.&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>It has been my pleasure to spend the last 2+ years writing with &lt;A href="http://www.mikedub.net/">Mike Wienhardt&lt;/A>. I remember fondly his first piece. When I give feedback, I work very hard to let the author know just exactly what I think so that they can bring their work to its highest possible potential. When Mike sent me his first draft, I was as careful as I could be to point out the parts that I liked to let him know that he had real potential, but basically, I ripped it apart. I have literally caused authors to tear up reading my feedback in the past, but I give Mike credit -- he turned his piece around and came right back for more. We did this 5 or 6 times, but by the end, his first piece was better than most of the experienced authors filling magazines and web sites. It has been a real pleasure watching him grow into his writing talent and it made me very happy when he accepted the major writing duties on &lt;a href="/public/writing/">the 2nd edition of Windows Forms Programming in C#&lt;/A> and when he took over &lt;A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/winforms.aspx">my Wonders of Windows Forms column&lt;/A>.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>In his most recent blog post, it was very interesting to &lt;A href="http://www.mikedub.net/windowsformsredux/archives/000032.html">read about Mike working his way through the worst part of writing: writer's block&lt;/A>. Nearly all authors get this occasionally and it's a real killer (and a pox on those authors that don't suffer from it). It makes me proud to see him so concerned about his writing that he's willing to share these kinds of experiences with the world. I wish more engineers took that kind of pride in their work. You're setting an example for us all, Mike.&lt;/P></content>
