    <summary>Wednesday, October 15, 2003 I got an email today from John Reilly today asking me a question I get from time to time: I got my signed copy of your book. It is a great read.

    <content type="html">&lt;h1>How Does One Obtain "Inside" Information?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;i>Wednesday, &lt;span class="created">October 15, 
2003&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/p>&lt;p>I got an email today from John Reilly today asking me a question 
I get from time to time:&lt;/p>&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>&lt;i>I got my signed copy of &lt;a href="/public/writing/wfbook">
	your book&lt;/a>. It is a great read. You have information that a friend and I 
	have been trying to dig out for weeks.&lt;/i>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;i>Which leads me to our 
	question. How do you find out all those details? They are not to be found in 
	the MSDN documentation, as far as we can tell. Do you just experiment, like 
	we do? We have been unable to find any .NET training that is much more than 
	how to use the IDE. Alan and I crave detail, meat, the stuff of your book. 
	Seriously, how does one obtain this seemingly inside information? We are 
	personally and professionally motivated weenies.&lt;/i>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;p>Now 
that I'm a Microsoft employee, I have access to not only the source for most of 
what I'm researching, but the architects and internal mailing lists populated by 
the developers on the project, so that really is &amp;quot;inside information.&amp;quot; However, 
over the 8+ years that I was a contributing member of the Windows developer 
community, 99% of what I've done has not been based on inside information. So, 
before I had access to internal info, how did I figure stuff out if the docs 
don't answer my questions? I do the following, in order of decreasing frequency:&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;span style="">
	I experiment, writing hundreds of projects consisting of 10 lines of code or 
	less to experiment with particular features&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="">I 
	read the source, even if that means reverse engineering it first (&lt;a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Reflector 
	is fabulous for .NET code&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="">I search on the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/microsoft.html">
	Microsoft-specific Google search page&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="">I 
	IM, email and call my friends who know more than I do (which is most of them 
	: )&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="">I ask questions on my &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic">
	favorite&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://discuss.develop.com">mailing&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/messageboard/Home.aspx">
	lists&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/newsgroups/">
	newsgroups&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="">As a last resort, I ask my 
	friends at MS. Buying a Microsoftie a beer at a conference, being smart in 
	online forums and saying nice things about their technologies are all 
	excellent ways to gain friends at MS&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>

While RSS is fairly unreadable for normal humans, computers eat it up. For 
example, if you read the RSS feed from my site on a regular basis, whenever I 
make a new post, you'll see a new entry in the RSS feed. RSS feeds aren't useful 
for you, but when fed to an &amp;quot;RSS reader&amp;quot; program, you can keep up to date on 
literally hundreds of web sites without having to browse to them manually. The 
RSS reader will check each RSS feed to which you subscribe, letting you know 
when something new on a web site has happened and showing you what it is, giving 
you the option to follow up or ignore the new thing. Thousands of sites have RSS 
feeds, letting me keep up on a bunch of things:&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>My friends' writings&lt;/li>&lt;li>
	Global and financial news&lt;/li>&lt;li>People talking about topics of interest to 
	me, like my favorite technologies or my latest book&lt;/li>&lt;li>My favorite 
	comics strips (I need my daily Dilbert!)&lt;/li>&lt;li>The latest product and 
	articles releases from Microsoft&lt;/li>&lt;li>Practically anything else I care 
	about on a regular basis&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>I keep up on all of this without ever 
visiting the web sites themselves them 'til something of interest catches my 
eye.&lt;/p>&lt;p>There are a bunch of RSS readers in the world, but &lt;a href="http://www.sharpreader.net">
my favorite is SharpReader&lt;/a>. If you install this program and start it up, SR 
will check all of the RSS feeds that you subscribe to on a regular basis in the 
background while you work, notifying you of something new by changing it's icon 
from blue to yellow. If you decide to install SharpReader, your next stop should 
be &lt;a href="http://www.newsisfree.com">NewsIsFree.com, where 
you'll find all kinds of RSS feeds in any number of categories&lt;/a>. After 
subscribing to a few of those, you'll want to stop by &lt;a href="http://dwlt.net/tapestry/">
Tapestry, where you can find RSS feeds for tons of daily comic strips&lt;/a>. If 
you want to get fancy, you can go to &lt;a href="http://www.googlealert.com/">
GoogleAlert, where you can subscribe to searches&lt;/a> so that whenever Google 
finds something new on your search topic, your RSS reader will let you know.&lt;/p>&lt;p>
If you find the ability to track hundreds of web sites without surfing to each 
of them manually, RSS is for you. If you find my instructions intimidating, ask 
a computer friend to help you out (I'll be home for Christmas, Mom).&lt;/p>

    <summary>Here. This year's PDC will turn the traditionally most boring day into potentially the most interesting. Jeremy Mazner's posted the list of panels we're having that day as well as a place for folks to seed the MCs of the panels with questions they'd like to have asked of the panelists. Should be fun!</summary>

If you do post a review, you'll likely get an email from me asking you to post it on Amazon.com.

I'm posting this here to a) warn you that a review on my book is likely to get you an email from me and b) because Scott Galloway's Contact form is busted ("You must enter a search term"), so I needed *some* way to ask him to post his review on Amazon. Thanks!</content>
