What if, on a mobile device, you could use web services to allow location-aware applications ultra-dynamic, serving up XAML UI code along with data? A thick thin-client? Talk about a contradiction in terms.

What Avalon allows is the ability to have a Button instance like so: &amp;lt;Window&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Button&amp;gt;Hello&amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Window&amp;gt; And then, somewhere else, using Styles, setting the VisualTree of what a Button looks like to be whatever you like, e.g. &amp;lt;Style&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Button /&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Style.VisualTree&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;FlowPanel&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nb...</summary>

&lt;P>Two&amp;nbsp;interesting things about this button style. The first is that you can&amp;nbsp;make a Button look however you want it to look,&amp;nbsp;without worrying whether the Avalon team had that in mind up front.&amp;nbsp;Two, when you want to drop in the content inside the Button tag, e.g. "Hello", you drop in the ContentPresentor and it knows how to&amp;nbsp;display what was placed in the Button (again, which&amp;nbsp;could be anything). Simple and flexible: two things that I'm finding to be true more and more about Avalon the further I dig.&lt;/P></content>

&lt;UL>
&lt;LI>"a library could not easily be updated since the CLR looked for an exact version match. There was a complex way to solve this problem through policy files; however, even engineers at Microsoft found this approach too difficult."&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>"Microsoft has a new approach for Longhorn and Orcas (.NET v3.0), which divides assemblies into two categories, Platforms and Libraries."&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>"Most assemblies will or should be libraries. Microsoft discourages the use of platform assemblies."&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>"There are actually three types of platform assemblies: System-wide, process-wide, and app domain-wide."&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>"Longhorn will no longer support multiple CLRs. Every managed application will be forced to use the latest version of the CLR on the system."&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>"Whidbey is expected to include an Assembly attribute, AssemblyFlagsAttribute, which allows to developer to specify Library, AppDomainPlatform, ProcessPlatform, SystemPlatform, or Legacy to identify the versioning scheme the CLR uses to load a reference assembly."&lt;/LI>&lt;/UL>
&lt;P>I know that the existing versioning story doesn't cut it for a lot of folks. Will this new model solve the problems? Is there a complexity danger?&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Also, &lt;A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/06/15/clrversioning">Ian has some thoughts on the new model&lt;/A>.&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>It seems to me that folks embrace ATOM mainly to get away from &lt;A href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/16#morningCoffeeNotes">the guy that's credited with inventing RSS&lt;/A>:&lt;/P>
&lt;blockquote>"I'm not running for president, I am not a corporate executive, and I don't tell bedtime stories to adults unless its for fun and they're friends. I can tell you what it feels like to be me, but I don't know how it feels to be you. I'm willing to listen, up to a point, but unless your site is hosted on weblogs.com, I don't understand why you're hogging the microphone right now. I believe so strongly in the weblog world, that we should be grounded in truth. I think a lot of people participating in this dicussion are not grounded in truth, deliberately so, openly so. Shame on you, I say."&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;P>This was said after he pulled down 3000 web sites he was hosting with no notice. ATOM is starting to sound more and more attractive...&lt;/P>
&lt;p>Because this post has cauesd Mr. Winer to start swearing at me, I thought I'd remind folks of the following:&lt;/p>
