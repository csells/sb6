&lt;P>Hell House is the name of a specific kind of "haunted house" exhibit that some churches run every year at Halloween. This movie is a documentary of the church that originated the practice and is in it's 10th year, having had 75,000 guests over that period. The hook is that the church puts on little mini-plays showing real-life horrors, e.g. domestic abuse, rape, murder, drunk driving, abortion and, sin-of-sins, homosexuality (which doesn't hurt anyone, of course, but gets them on the news every year).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>At the end of each tour through the Hell House scenes is a room with a member of the church applying age old used car salesman techniques to pressure people into converting or recommitting to the church. There success rate is 20%, which is why hundreds of churches around the country have adopted this practice.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>It amazes me that such a thing actually happens. The techniques they use reminds me of a cross between the horror movies we was made to watch in driver's ed and the pressure our society puts on our children to believe in Santa. Don't cults get into trouble for this kind of thing? Truth is truly stranger than fiction.&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>Just flew in from California... and boy are my arms tired! &amp;lt;shot area="rim" /&amp;gt;&lt;/P>
&lt;P>We did 4 California theme parks in 4 days and here's what I thought:&lt;/P>
&lt;OL>
&lt;LI>&lt;A href="http://www.sixflags.com/parks/magicmountain/index.asp">Magic Mountain&lt;/A>: great rides, but even before spring break, the best rides had waits of 2-3 hours, so we didn't get to go on them (although Scream rocked). Also, the price gouging was gratuitous, including $3 for a soda, $.87 for a packet of ranch dressing and extra money for a bunch of the activities after paying to get into the park, e.g. virtual reality ride and rock climbing. Over all, thumbs down.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>&lt;A href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/dlr/landing/parkDCA">Disney's California Adventure&lt;/A>: Surprisingly good. The production values are high, even making the waiting as fun as possible, just like in every Disney park. The Bugs Life "it's hard to be a bug" show was hilarious and the Soarin' Over California ride took my breath away. Plus, all of the rides that had analogs in Magic Mountain were better at California Adventure. This was the winner of the trip. Thumbs up.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>&lt;A href="http://seaworld.com/seaworld/ca/default.aspx">San Diego Sea World&lt;/A>: The day was a little overcast and their major ride wasn't running, but the shows were fun and it was a nice, mellow experience after two intense days.&amp;nbsp;Also, the food was noticeably better than the other parks (although $50 on lunch for 4 was a bit much).&amp;nbsp;More on the meal front: I called Don&amp;nbsp;on the road between Sea World and the hotel in LA and he recommended In-n-Out Burger, which none of us had ever had before.&amp;nbsp;My oldest son mentioned that meal more than Sea World, so both get a thumbs up.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>&lt;A href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/dlr/landing/parkDLP">Disneyland&lt;/A>: This park needs an overhaul. Their one really good ride, Indiana Jones, was closed and all of the rest of the rides were only interesting for the nostalgia factor&amp;nbsp;(plus they broke down a lot).&amp;nbsp;When I brought my 4-5 year olds here 4 years ago, it was really great to see the place again through their eyes. Now that they're older, the place holds no attraction for me. Thumbs down.&lt;/LI>&lt;/OL>
&lt;P>Over all the trip was a thumbs up if for no other reason than I was without my laptop for 4 days and didn't really miss it. Then I come home to find that &lt;A href="/1205">you dang kids have TP'd my blog&lt;/A>! : )&lt;/P></content>
