&lt;p>I sat down to write a new Windows Forms application in .NET 1.1 the other day, but the Visual Studio 2005 beta 1 called to me with its &amp;quot;menu strips&amp;quot; and its &amp;quot;user settings&amp;quot; and most especially its &amp;quot;generics,&amp;quot; and I just couldn't resist.&lt;/p>&lt;p>To start with, it was such a pleasure to add a menu strip, add in the standard menu items (including graphics), then just strip it down to just the menu items I wanted. Then, as I added new menu items, the menu item object names were set for me based on the menu item text, e.g. startRetrievalToolStripMenuItem instead of menuItem1, which was fabulous. Not everything was wonderful, e.g. I couldn't drag and drop menu items or use Alt+arrows to rearrange them , but overall the new menu control was a pleasant experience.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Even &lt;em>more &lt;/em>pleasant was the app/user settings model. To add a setting to my application, all I had to do was bring up the properties of my project, add a named setting of whatever type I wanted (more on this later) and choose whether it should be an Application setting or a User setting. Both kinds of settings are loaded automatically when the app starts and all I had to do to save them was call Properties.Settings.Value.Save() when my main form shut down. Then, with the settings in place, e.g. MyUserSetting, I could get to it after the app started from anyone in my app with a type-safe access, e.g. Properties.Settings.Value.MyUserSetting.&lt;/p>&lt;p>And this didn't just work for built-in simple strings and ints and such like. Oh, no. I was allowed to add custom and collection types like System.Collections.Generic.List&amp;lt;MyNamespace.MyType&amp;gt; as well. Plus, using generics, the underlying XML serialization mechanism worked great, because all of the types are known at compile-time (settings are stored in standard XML .config files @ c:\documents and settings\&amp;lt;user name&amp;gt;\Local Settings\Application Data\&amp;lt;company name&amp;gt;\&amp;lt;product name_hash&amp;gt;\&amp;lt;product version&amp;gt;\user.config). Being able to declaratively set app and user settings of any type and then just use them in a type-safe manner, saving them with one line of code, loading them with &lt;em>zero &lt;/em>lines of code and not having to flatten my collections into comma-separated lists made things &lt;em>so &lt;/em>pleasant until I hit the ugly realities of beta software, especially as new features interact with existing features and each other.&lt;/p>&lt;p>For example, because the default AssemblyVersion attribute is set to &amp;quot;1.0.*&amp;quot; in AssemblyInfo.cs (which has moved to below the Properties folder of your VS05 project), every time I compiled, all of my settings were lost. That seems very counterintuitive to me. Why should a user lose all of their settings with the new version of the application? To work around this, I changed my AssemblyVersion attribute to a hard-coded string that I now have to remember to change manually, blowing the benefit of having a version number that changes automatically with each build.&lt;/p>&lt;p>As another example, like C++ &amp;quot;const&amp;quot; of old, generics infect your code; use them in one place and you find yourself using them all over. That was fine with me (the generic Predicate&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; for finding things in a List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; was &lt;em>so&lt;/em> handy!) except that as of b1, the Windows Forms Designer gets all unhappy when you use generics. I have every hope that this will be fixed by b2, but as of right now, if I wanted to use the Designer (and it's &lt;em>so&lt;/em> sweet, how could I &lt;em>not&lt;/em> want to use it?!?), I had to strip out any methods or properties in my visual code that exposed generics (although method and property implementations with generics works just fine).&lt;/p>&lt;p>Stripping out List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; brought me to the use of ArrayList instead. That worked just fine (System.Collections.ArrayList is even available via the Browse button when setting up app/user settings) until the XML serializer couldn't serialize instances of the custom type that I was using to populate my ArrayList. The error looked like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>Could not use Xml serialization for setting: SelectedExchanges. ---&amp;gt;
System.InvalidOperationException: There was an error generating the XML document. ---&amp;gt;
System.InvalidOperationException: The type MyNamespace.MyType was not expected.
Use the XmlInclude or SoapInclude attribute to specify types that are not known statically.&lt;/pre>&lt;p>When I start up the debugger to see the line of code where the error is happening, I ended up in Main because the code is part of the Application start-up for which there is no source code, making this even more difficult to debug. The problem was that the underlying serialization engine didn't know what to do with this custom type. The clue was the mention of the XmlInclude attribute, which you can use to tell the serializer what types may be in the ArrayList, but you have to have somewhere to hang the attributes. In this case, that lead to a custom ArrayList type for the express purpose of informing the serializer (making me &lt;em>really&lt;/em> miss the use of generics, where all of the types were specified at compile-type for me automatically):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;strong>[System.Xml.Serialization.XmlInclude(typeof(MyNamespace.MyType))]
public class MyList : System.Collections.ArrayList&lt;/strong> {
&lt;strong>  public override object Clone() {
&lt;/strong>    MyList newList = new MyList();
    newList.AddRange(this);
    return newList;
&lt;strong>  }
}&lt;/strong>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Notice also the Clone method. I added this later because the base ArrayList Clone method creates an instance of ArrayList, not my custom MyList type. Of course, since this was all run-time type errors, I couldn't let the compiler tell me about these problems; I had to run my app and find them. Very frustrating, especially when generics makes these problems all go away.&lt;/p>&lt;p align="left">Still, I'm very much enjoying the new productivity features in VS05 and Windows Forms 2.0 and when they work better together, I'll be even more happy.&lt;/p></content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1>Mixed Feelings&lt;/h1>
&lt;P>For the last few months, I've been doing some really cool work with a group of folks whose only task is to build apps that exercise the WinFX technologies so that we can make sure stuff works the way we want it to and give feedback to the product teams when it doesn't. Because we're still in preview technology land, various features that we want to test are in various builds of each part of WinFX, so we're constantly fooling around with new combinations of the bits, which we bring together in VPC HD images and that I then have to download. Since I'm downloading the 7+ GB images from my house over VNC and since the internal VNC connection software isn't quite as robust as the VNC software we ship to the rest of the world, that means that I'm constantly being kicked off of my connection and reconnecting, sometimes 2 or 3 dozen times over the 2 days it takes me to download the image. I just finished downloading another build today.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Unfortunately, when setting the Administrator password, I managed to enter the wrong thing twice, which meant that I had no way to log into my new VPC image after 2 days of hard labor getting it to my house. So, instead of re-downloading it again, I googled for a utility to reset the Administrator password. The first link was a knowledge base article from MS that didn't help me because I hadn't yet logged in to make myself a password reset diskette (which, frankly, I never do anyway). The second link was a list of completely unsupported, possibly illegal, tools to reset the Administrator password. The first one on that list worked like a charm in several orders of magnitude less time than downloading a new VPC image.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>So, now I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, I'm happy that I didn't have to go through all that trouble again, but on the other, I doesn't seem very useful to set my Administrator password to anything useful if I anyone with physical access can just reset it so easily. Of course, &lt;A href="http://www.pluralsite.com/blogs/keith/default.aspx">Keith Brown&lt;/A> and other security experts have been saying that physical security is paramount for any other kind of security to be affective, but it was kind of unsettling to have the point driven home so starkly.&lt;/P></content>

A $19 charge was approved, but the $331 charge swung the BankOne AI software into action and the charge was declined. They called right away to confirm the activity and when I didn't recognize it, they credited me the $19, canceled the card, put a new one in the mail, sent all three major credit card agencies a notice so that my credit rating wouldn't be affected and put an affidavit in the mail so that I could swear that the $19 charge wasn't mine. All of this defense against identity theft cost me 5 minutes on the phone, a few days wait while I receive my new card, a signature and $0. Amazing.</content>

We didn't actually remodel anything while our stuff was on the lawn, but the whole place seems much bigger since emptying the things we no longer used out of the house and completely filling a&amp;nbsp;2-car garage before hauling the stuff off to &lt;A href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/cleansweep/cleansweep.html">Powell's book store&lt;/A> (they buy as well as sell) and conducting not one but two giant garage sales in two separate neighborhoods. The $5671 we earned along the way was just found money (especially Melissa's paycheck... : ).&lt;/P></content>

    <title>Tim Ewald On MSDN2 Internals</title>

    <summary>Tim Ewald, the architect of the MSDN2 web site (still in alpha) talks about how and why it was built and points out some undocumented features, particularly in the new URL by alias scheme. Plus, I don't know if it's not experiencing the load of the old site yet or that it's not built from HxS files, but MSDN2 smokes perf-wise. Highly recommended.

&lt;P>Tim Ewald, the architect of &lt;A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/">the MSDN2 web site (still in alpha)&lt;/A> &lt;A href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2004/09/23/2368.aspx">talks about how and why it was built and points out some undocumented features&lt;/A>, particularly in the new URL by alias scheme.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Plus, I don't know if it's not experiencing the load of the old site yet or that it's not built from HxS files, but &lt;A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/">MSDN2 &lt;EM>smokes&lt;/EM> perf-wise&lt;/A>. Highly recommended.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Also, if you want to know Tim's thoughts on building giant, scalable web sites based on XML and web services (both input internally and hopefully output externally someday), check out &lt;A HREF="/public/conference/">his keynote at the Applied XML Developer's Conference, October 20-21&lt;/A>. We've already sold out once and had to request more space, so &lt;A href="https://www.pluralsight.com/events/devcon/secure/register.aspx">register quickly&lt;/A>.&lt;/P>
&lt;p>BTW, since &lt;a href="http://www.pluralsite.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2004/09/23/2371.aspx">Tim no longer works at Microsoft&lt;/a> (bad for us), you should get a lot more candid view on what he really thinks in his keynote (good for you). I, for one, can't wait. : )&lt;/p></content>
