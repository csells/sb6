&lt;P>I've been digging into .NET application extensibility lately, discovering the various pieces discussed &lt;A href="/1708">here&lt;/A>. And then, just when I'd despaired of finding a resource that covered the issues in depth, a copy of "&lt;A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619883/chrissells/">Customizing the Microsoft .NET Framework Common Language Runtime&lt;/A>," by Steven Pratscher, showed up at my door (that happens sometimes, but I've never quite figured out how...).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Steven's a PM on the CLR team and his book has wonderful chapter titles like:&lt;/P>
&lt;UL>
&lt;LI>Loading Assemblies in Extensible Applications&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>Extending the CLR Security System to Protect Your Extensible Application&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>Enforcing Application-Specific Programming Model Constraints&lt;/LI>&lt;/UL>
&lt;P>And if you're thinking, "Big deal, .NET 2.0 is coming out soon and will makes this info obsolete," au contraire, mon frere! This book is based on the .NET 2.0 beta, so the concepts (and hopefully most of the details) are&amp;nbsp;the latest and greatest (and you can download the source that goes along with the book &lt;A href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/books/products/6895/">here&lt;/A>). I plan on having quite a bit of fun with this book! Thank you book-mailing-to-my-house-god, wherever you are...&lt;/P></content>

The first chapter starts with a loser waking up from an alcoholic black-out, going out to look for his drug stash, finding his wife's head instead and spending the rest of the book wondering if he killed her or not. Run, don't walk, from the movie. If you have to be run over by a bus in the process, consider yourself lucky.&lt;/span>&lt;/font> &lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h1>&lt;b>&lt;font face="Arial" size="5">&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt">Fantasy&lt;/span>&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&lt;/h1>&lt;ul type="disc">&lt;li class="MsoNormal">&lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&amp;quot;&lt;a title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765300346/" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765300346/">War for the Oaks&lt;/a>,&amp;quot; by Emma Bull, is about a punk band leader that falls in love with an elf from the St. Paul, MN parks.

R. R. Tolkien has to be on anyone's list. If you loved the movies, you'll love the books. I believe that &amp;quot;The Hobbit&amp;quot; is a better book over all; it's tighter and happier and I'm very much looking forward to the movie, especially if Peter Jackson does it. However, my favorite part of the four books is the &amp;quot;coming home&amp;quot; part at the back half of &amp;quot;The Return of the King,&amp;quot; which is given a 3-minute scene in the movie (although I admit it's a nicely done scene).&lt;/span>&lt;/font> &lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h1>&lt;b>&lt;font face="Arial" size="5">&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt">Sci-Fi&lt;/span>&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&lt;/h1>&lt;ul type="disc">&lt;li class="MsoNormal">&lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&amp;quot;&lt;a title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743435710/" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743435710/">On Basilisk Station&lt;/a>,&amp;quot; by David Weber, is the first in a long series about a driven, capable woman rising through the ranks of the space navy in spite of the extreme assholes working double-time against her. The main character is so compelling that I cry at the end of 3 of the first 4 books in this series (did I mention what a sap I was?).&lt;/span>&lt;/font>&lt;/li>&lt;li class="MsoNormal">&lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&amp;quot;&lt;a title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812550706/" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812550706/">Ender's Game&lt;/a>,&amp;quot; by Orson Scott Card, is about a boy genius coddled by his sister, tortured by his brother and abandoned by his parents to military school where he saves the world from bug-eyed aliens before he's old enough for his voice to change. This book is widely regarded as one of the best pieces of modern science fiction that there is. The sequels in the original series are also excellent, but you can skip the other related series w/o missing much.&lt;/span>&lt;/font>&lt;/li>&lt;li class="MsoNormal">&lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&amp;quot;&lt;a title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380958/" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380958/">Snow Crash&lt;/a>,&amp;quot; by Neal Stephenson, is a classic tale of a pizza delivery man/samurai named &amp;quot;Hiro Protagonist&amp;quot; and his virtual reality gear. It's also one of the seminal works in the &amp;quot;cyberpunk&amp;quot; genre.&lt;/span>&lt;/font>&lt;/li>&lt;li class="MsoNormal">&lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&amp;quot;&lt;a title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451197968/" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451197968/">The Running Man&lt;/a>,&amp;quot; by Steven King, is about a man that can't tolerate his place in the society of the future, so rams a commercial airliner into the top floor of an evil television network responsible for man's downfall (you can see the ending coming a mile away, but it's still very satisfying). Much, much better than the movie.&lt;/span>&lt;/font> &lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h1>&lt;b>&lt;font face="Arial" size="5">&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt">Misc.&lt;/span>&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&lt;/h1>&lt;ul type="disc">&lt;li class="MsoNormal">&lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&amp;quot;&lt;a title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671510053/" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671510053/">Shipping News&lt;/a>,&amp;quot; by Annie Proulx, is an actual Pulitzer Price winner and as such, is different from your average &amp;quot;reading&amp;quot; book. However, I love its quirkiness and the movie ain't bad, either.&lt;/span>&lt;/font> &lt;/li>&lt;li class="MsoNormal">&lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&amp;quot;&lt;a title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446673781/" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446673781/">One L&lt;/a>,&amp;quot; by Scott Turow.
