        &lt;p>Do you feel it? I do and I know that a bunch of my friends do. The 
        whole IT industry is in recovery from the crashing lows that can only 
        happen after impossible highs. In recent conversations, I hear terms 
        like &amp;quot;burned out,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;bitter&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;jaded&amp;quot; coming up again and again in our 
        conversations. Since I got into this industry just as it was idling 
        before take off, I have no frame of reference, but I'm guessing that 
        things will level off at a bit better cash flow than right now, but much 
        better morale.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>The question is, how long will it take for the energy and excitement 
        to come back? I know that 
        I'm still healing from a three-year stint on my last big project, and 
        even though I have an itch to try something else, I fantasize about 
        trying my hand at another industry. I always figured that the shake-out 
         
        would make the bottom feeders leave for something else, 
        but now that we seemed to have settled on good, although not great, 
        salaries and benefits and shaky processes at best, how many of the top 
        folks will just bail from something else? I haven't actually seen anyone 
        I respect leave for greener pastures, so I've got my fingers crossed 
        that things will turn around.&lt;/p>
