    <summary>I got my Qtek 8500 today. The bad news was that I got the French version of the manual, but that wasn't so bad, since I wasn't going to read the manual anyway. However, the worse news was that all of the phone menus where in French, too.

&lt;P>I got my Qtek 8500 today. The bad news was that I got the French version of the manual, but that wasn't so bad, since I wasn't going to read the manual anyway. However, the worse news was that all of the phone menus where in French, too. The nice folks at &lt;A href="http://expansys.com">expansys.com&lt;/A> were quick to send me the set of menus to turn English back on, but the instructions they sent where themselves in English, which required me to do a little &lt;A href="http://babelfish.altavista.com">babelfish&lt;/A> work to translate into French menu text, but I managed.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Things I like about my new phone:&lt;/P>
&lt;UL>
&lt;LI>It's a flip phone that looks almost exactly like the famous RAZR, but runs Windows Mobile 5, allowing me to sync my email, contacts and appointments, play my music, load my own apps, etc. Physically, it feels very nice -- thin, but solid. Even the flat keypad feels nice.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>I really like the higher res screen (when compared to my Audiovox 5600) and the larger keyboard (handy when you've got sausage fingers like mine).&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>I like the external screen with the clock (a nice round analog one, too), the battery, the email count and three buttons for controlling the audio.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>The reception is better than my Audiovox.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>The volume on both my existing bluetooth headset and the included headphones is louder than my Audiovox (which is good for an aging Def Leppard fan...).&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>I love not having to lock the keys on my phone -- just flip it!&lt;/LI>&lt;/UL>
&lt;P>Things I don't like about my new phone:&lt;/P>
&lt;UL>
&lt;LI>The single, proprietary USB port (they call it an "extUSB," whatever the hell that is). It's for power, data and audio, which is handy, but I've got a bunch of mini-USD cables that no longer work, as well no way to connect my fully music-capable phone to the mini-jack in my car. I can get a &lt;A href="http://www.mobileplanet.com/product.asp?code=137745">conversion from extUSB to mini-USB on expansys.com&lt;/A>, but so far, I've found no way of connecting the phone to my car.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>The camera's high-res (1.3M), but doesn't seem to focus very well.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>I haven't yet found the button or option that allows me to set flight mode. Given the amount of air travel I do, that's kind of a problem. Hopefully the pictures in my French manual will provide a clue...&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>My $19 1GB mini-SD card doesn't fit -- I need *micro*-SD (who knew?!?). Luckily, &lt;A href="http://www.mobileplanet.com/product.asp?code=133709">micro-SD cards are pretty cheap&lt;/A>, but it'd be nice to use my existing mini-SD cards, especially since the included storage was just enough to hold a single MP3 file...&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>I don't like the Start menu laid out in a 3x3 grid -- I prefer to have things in a list with numbers by 'em, like in WM 2003SE. As it turns out, the numbers still work, but they're not shown.&lt;/LI>&lt;/UL>
&lt;P>It's true that I've listed more things I don't like than that I do, but most of the stuff I don't like is nuisance and the stuff I do like is very, very cool. I don't know about battery life yet or what I'm going to think over time, but right now, I really like this phone. &lt;A href="http://www.mobileplanet.com/product.asp?code=133791">Recommended.&lt;/A>&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>Being first with hardware is not generally something I like to do. In general, I purchase laptops and cell phones and not many of either (usually one every 18 months of either). Frankly, I'm a late adopter on&amp;nbsp;hardware 'cuz I like to handle someone else's&amp;nbsp;first (no snide comments, please... : ).&amp;nbsp;However, the experience with my Audiovox 5600 has been so positive and the features of the QTEK 8500 are so overwhelming (on paper) that I just had to get it ASAP. It's really the first Windows Mobile 5 phone I've found compelling.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Stay tuned for a review.&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>I've been doing some design work with a small part of my new team for a few months now and we've gotten largely on the same page with each other. However, there were 20-some odd folks that we hadn't done a good job keeping on the same page, so &lt;A href="http://simplegeek.com">ChrisAn&lt;/A> proposed an off-site. I proposed the format:&lt;/P>
&lt;UL>
&lt;LI>45-minute slots for each "bucket" of design functionality with the owner of the bucket leading the discussion (my boss, &lt;A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572313501">Adam&lt;/A>, wanted to make sure that at least half of each talk was *not* lecture from the speaker). Each session was followed with a 15-minute break.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>90-minute break-out sessions where each person had to pick their technology bucket and work with the owner to produce a 2-page functional spec and a 2-page technical spec.&lt;/LI>&lt;/UL>
&lt;P>If this format sounds like a tweaked &lt;a href="/conference">DevCon&lt;/A> to you, then you know where I got the format.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>We started at 8am (1-2 hours before most folks start their day @ MS), so that gave us a little shared adversity to help build the team.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>The 45 minute sessions made sure that the presenter had to get to the meat quickly, while the 15 minute breaks allowed folks some downtime to catch their breaths, check their email and chat with their brethren (this was a new team, so "bonding" time was an important element).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>The 90 minute break-outs allowed folks to self-select into the bucket that most interested them, validated that we had the right buckets (any bucket w/ too few people would be cut, whereas any bucket w/ too many people would be split), helped establish the base-line for each bucket's future (we used the off-site to kick-start the buckets) and gave the team a seemingly impossible task given the amount of time they had (shared impossible task == more team building).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Like your average DevCon, the "DesignCon" worked pretty well. We generated a ton of issues in each bucket that the owner hadn't yet thought of and gave the entire team a kick-start down the road to shared pov. Also, since we had some folks from other, related teams and from upper management, we made sure we were communicating up and out as well as internally.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Of course, just as no DevCon is perfect, neither was the DesignCon, but if you're looking for a way to get your team pointed in the same direction, I find the DesCon format a good one.&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>I chased this with my ISP a few days ago, but futzing with it made it go away mysteriously. When it came back, it came back with a vengeance and I pulled in every ASP.NET 2.0 resource I could think of to fix it, including sending ScottGu the FTP user name and password to sellsbrothers.com (my site hasn't fit into a reasonable .zip file for a while now : ).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>The thing I did that fixed the problem (seemingly consistently), came from Scott himself; I added the batch="false" attribute to my compilation element in my web.config file:&lt;/P>

&lt;P>Apparently this ends up generating a lot more assemblies than 'batch="true"', but I don't know why that would fix the problem or even what's causing the problem. This never happens in &lt;A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321267966/">WinForms&lt;/A> or &lt;A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596101139/">Avalon&lt;/A>&amp;nbsp;(and, of course, neither of those&amp;nbsp;technologies have issues of their own...&amp;nbsp;: ).&lt;/P>
&lt;P>Thanks Scott, Ting-Hao, Simon and David!&lt;/P>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1>T-Mobile Smartphone Fun Facts&lt;/h1>
&lt;P>A coupla weeks ago, the AT&amp;amp;T wireless cell phone reception at my house went through the floor. I called up the nice folks at Cingular and they guaranteed me that my reception would improve if I moved my old AT&amp;amp;T account to Cingular&amp;nbsp;(Cingular owns both, after all). When that didn't work, I went to the mall, signed up for T-Mobile, went to my house and, when the reception was much better, had 'em move my phone number over. Since then, I've been moving my smartphone along with me (I have a &lt;A href="http://www.mobileplanet.com/product.asp?code=133791&amp;amp;tab=0">QTEK 8500&lt;/A> on order, but my Audiovox 5600 is still the greatest thing to happen to me since my first laptop). Here's what I've found:&lt;/P>
&lt;UL>
&lt;LI>To get the data working (assuming you've selected that account option from T-Mobile), set up a GPRS connection that connects to the internet and uses "wap.voicestream.com" as the Access Point (no user name, password or DNS addresses). There's no need for a proxy connection, but make sure that your IE connection options use the internet as its network (I mistakenly had it set to WAP at first).&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>To use the phone as a modem for use in connecting to the internet, pair the phone w/ your computer using Bluetooth (make sure to put the phone into discovery mode so that Windows can find it) and then use the new COM port that Windows adds (COM4 on my machine) to set up a dial-up network connection, using "*99#" as the phone number (no user name or password). I get this working when I called T-Mobile and they walked me through the setup, even though the Audiovox isn't a supported phone and the tech support guy had no documentation on one.&lt;/LI>
&lt;LI>This isn't phone related, but once you've got a T-Mobile data plan, you should be able to use WiFi from your laptop at a T-Mobile HotSpot by using your 10-digit phone number as the user name and the last 4 digits of your SSN as your password (I haven't tried this yet, but I plan to!).&lt;/LI>&lt;/UL>
&lt;P>Theoretically, I should be able to use ActiveSync via Bluetooth, but I haven't figured out how to make that work yet.&lt;/P>
&lt;P>So far, I'm loving T-Mobile, not just 'cuz of the rates and the features, but also because they seem to understand that some folks aren't going to want to be stuck with the phones that they sell and they actually help you make them work. T-Mobile's not the biggest network, but apparently that makes 'em try harder. Recommended.&lt;/P></content>

&lt;P>However, as to the signed copies, I still want you to have those. So, the first 5 people to tell me the 2nd word in the 3nd paragraph of prose on page 444, I'll send you a signed copy. Whether you purchase a copy or just go to the bookstore and look up the word is up to you.&lt;/P></content>
