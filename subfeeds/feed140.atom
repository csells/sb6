    <summary>From Matthew Mastracci: I just released the third alpha version of my open-source.NET profiling application. It supports everything I've thrown at it so far (multi-threaded programs, NAnt, SWF apps) and is getting close to feature-complete. It comes with a basic VS.NET add-in that lets you profile from DevStudio. There is a source package on the downloads page for those who are interested in tinkering. Download it at http://nprof.sourceforge.net

&lt;p>This is a recipe that I sent in for the O'Reilly title &amp;quot;Gastronomy for 
Geeks&amp;quot;. It was handed down to me by my grandfather at our cabin on the lake. He 
was into manly food that sticks to your rips and left the more delicate dishes 
to my grandmother.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>1 15oz can of cream-style corn&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>1 15oz can of non-cream-style corn (drained)&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>2 cups of crushed saltine crackers (although other crackers and even 
	potato chips work well)&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>3 eggs&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>1 cup of milk (scant)&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>1 tablespoon of butter or margarine&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2>Number of Servings&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>9 normal human servings or&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>3 hungry developer servings&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2>Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>Grease 7&amp;quot; cake pan (or nearest equivalent, Grandpa wasn't picky)&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Mix cream-style and drained non-cream-style corn together in mixing bowl&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Spread 1/2 of the corn along the bottom of the cake pan&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Spread 1/2 of the crackers over the layer of corn&lt;br>
	Repeat for one more layer of corn and crackers&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Beat eggs and milk together for 2 minutes in a mixing bowl (preferably 
	the corn mixing bowl, which should now be empty, to save on dishes that need 
	washing)&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Put egg/milk mixture over the layers of corn and crackers, using a fork 
	to poke holes in the layers to allow egg/milk mixture to seep into all 
	crevices&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Drop button (or margarine) in dots over the top&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Bake at 350 for one hour or until top is golden brown&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Bake at 200 for 30 more minutes for rustic Grandpa goodness&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Let cool for as long as you can stand to wait, cut into pleasing shapes 
	and serve&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
