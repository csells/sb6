That's a cool dream. But noooo, you can't do that one, because you're just a shill for US big oil! Sorry about that... I now return you to your regularly scheduled programming. </summary>

And there are a core set of graphical objects like images, text, maps, and calendars, which everybody has to reinvent every time they need one in their application, and they usually do a lousy job of reinventing it. Sure, there are classes for some of these things in GUI libraries, but the user doesn't see that - they see the programmer's personal interpretation of how they think it should look and work."&lt;/P>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1>Surprised by Microsoft's Openness&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;i>Friday, &lt;span class="created">January 9th, 2004&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/p>&lt;p>
I get a lot of emails from folks surprised about how open Microsoft is being 
lately, mostly due to all of the blogging we've been doing lately (some of us 
started long before we ever became employees). However, even I was surprised in 
an internal blogging meeting today filled with a bunch of MS bloggers. During 
the meeting, we talked about a bunch of the benefits to MS and to our customers. 
Sara talked about how blogs are driving more traffic to MSDN than our own 
headlines. Robert described his &amp;quot;green, yellow, red&amp;quot; scale for determining 
whether to blog about something (believe it or not, he does decide not to 
sometimes : ).&lt;/p>&lt;p>And then Adam Sohn from marketing talked about the need to 
police ourselves, describing some of the downsides in regards to blowing some 
group's launch plans or unconstructively criticizing another group. He preached 
caution when approaching the line between what was good for the customer and 
what was good for Microsoft. After listening to what I began to interpret as a 
message of self-censorship, I asked Adam a warm up, &amp;quot;Isn't it true that a lot of 
the stuff close to the 'line' is what our customers find most valuable?&amp;quot; He 
agreed that it was. And then I asked Adam my real question, &amp;quot;So, when we get 
close to that line, do we err on the side of our customer or ourselves?&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;p>
Now, you have to remember that I've been a contributing member of the Windows 
development community for a lot of years. I've seen how aggressive Microsoft is 
in everything it does to always be on top. So when I asked on what side of the 
line I should come down, I fully expected to be told to keep the shareholders in 
mind.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Of course, you know what his answer was or this story wouldn't have 
made it into my blog until after my tenure at MS was complete (or just before : 
). He said, without hesitation, &amp;quot;Err on the side of the customer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;p>That 
blew me away. Of course, I've been doing just that since before I became an MS 
employee and Robert rides the ragged edge all day long, but it was *very* nice 
to hear that guy with the PR and legal battle scars tell me to keep the customer 
first and foremost in my mind.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Thanks, Adam. You've confirmed my decision 
to work at Microsoft.&lt;/p>
