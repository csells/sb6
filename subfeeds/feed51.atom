'Let's take the best from the Web client world and the best from the rich client world, and&amp;#8212;voila!&amp;#8212;you have a smart client,' Somasegar says. Smart clients can allow several applications to share code with one another while using minimal resources, eliminating the need to duplicate coding efforts; essentially, if one application requires a piece of code existing already in another application, it simply can request the code to be sent over. 'The cheapest piece of code is the piece of code that you don't have to write in the first place,' Somasegar says, as smart clients provide interoperability through Web services and leverage existing investments. 'Enabling developers to reuse existing assets is a key design goal.' The end result of using a smart client, ultimately, is a rich user experience that requires using minimal resources."&lt;/EM></content>

Rudder asserted that Indigo will provide improved interoperability and productivity, as well as a more flexible security model for developers creating service-oriented applications. He also noted that Indigo will make it easier to build secure, reliable, transacted Web services."&lt;/EM>
&lt;p />
By far my favorite part of this presentation (except for watching Ari's heart beat at 155bpm) was watching Eric show the small transitions needed to move existing code to Indigo from ASMX, Enterprise Services, WSE2, MSMQ and Remoting and how well Indigo will integrate with BizTalk and SQL Server in the future. I'm sure it won't all be changing attributes and removing extraneous code, but if the majority of the porting work fits that model, I'll be impressed indeed. Of course, as Eric says, there's no requirement to move your code to Indigo if you don't want to; the goal of the Indigo team is to make it smooth if you want to.
&lt;p />
And finally, Eric says that we'll be releasing a new WinFX CTP in March, which will include both Avalon and Indigo (although it may be March 38th or March 43rd : ).</content>

To illustrate this technique, Kim Wolk has built a little prototype that lets you associate an XPATH statement with a method on an object and that method will be invoked for the nodes that match the XPATH statement. Check it out. Update: Steve Dunn has ported Kim's sample from.NET 2.0 beta to.NET 1.1. Thanks, Steve!</summary>
