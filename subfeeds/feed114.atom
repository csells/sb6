However, with the end of that same sentence, he sent chills down my spine, "... this means that one dev can overwhelm a tester pretty quickly."

He goes on to wonder whether, because managed code has fewer bugs, we'll be able to keep going or have to increase the number of testers. The thing that scares me is that testers are a rare breed, hard to find and hard to keep, especially as many of them want to cut their own code, not report bugs on someone else's.

Is the next growth industry in the IT industry testers? Is the next DevelopMentor an out-sourced QA company?</content>

Plus, I have that kind of a mind well-suited to programming. I continue to code as a way to a) learn how MS's latest technologies work and b) make my computer do what I want it to do.

&lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/analysis/univ/index.html">Here&lt;/a>. The recent economic conditions caused me to become very interested in not just making money (I've always been a capitalist : ), but also in keeping a careful eye on it.

In the past, I've let most of the "keeping an eye on it" be done by a financial advisor (I've had one since I was 22). These days, I have a stack of financial books that I'm reading [1] and it's been a fabulous educational experience.

Given the supreme importance of money in our society, I think everyone should know the basics of money management. I'm very disappointed that I made it all the way through high school, let alone college, with no more instruction then how to fill in a check (something we want folks to do less of, not more!).

Towards that end, I really love Bloomberg University’s no-frills financial tutorials, including one on the basics of a 401(k) and another on the basics of investing. They provide just the tip of the iceberg and I could recommend a lot of other reading, but this is a good place to start for folks that want to actually keep the money they make.
