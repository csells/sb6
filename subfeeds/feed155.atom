    <content type="html">&lt;h1>"Spend A Day With .NET" Winning Entries&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Sorry it took so long to judge the entries, but I was overwhelmed. That'll 
teach me to host &lt;a href="/12646">an international, pan-galactic, cross-universe 
coding contest&lt;/a>. : )&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Grand Prize Winner and Best Developer Tool: 
&lt;a href="mailto:Stoyan.Damov@rila.com">Stoyan Damov&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Stoyan wins the grand prize of free admission to the
&lt;a href="/conference">Web Services DevCon&lt;/a>. His entry is shown here:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Stoyan%20screen%20shot.JPG" width="679" height="390">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>KbView allows the user to pick a technology or set of technologies that s/he 
is interested in and see what's new in that space. Once the articles are 
fetched, they're listed on the right hand side, where they can be shown directly 
in the text viewer below or they can be hosted in a separate IE window. Also, 
once the article has been downloaded, it's cached for quick access for next time. 
This is an app that I will use. Great work, Stoyan!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Best Rookie: &lt;a href="mailto:sorinj@softhome.net">Sorin Jianu&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Sorin wins a year 
subscription to MSDN Universal for his submission:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Sorin%20Jianu%20screen%20shot.JPG" width="471" height="430">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sorin's submission is a functional proxy server and represents his first .NET 
project ever. It's fully asychronous and uses non-blocking I/O. It's quite a 
testament to what can be done in .NET in a single day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Most Polished: &lt;a href="mailto:jeffb@onlinetoolworks.com">Jeff Braunstein&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Jeff wins a 12-month 
subscription (5 points) to Safari Tech Books Online for his entry:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Jeff%20Brawstein%20screen%20shot.JPG" width="547" height="359">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeff's entry was the most polished I got, both in the UI as shown above, but 
also in the documentation, which included a market justification. I can see Jeff 
selling a version of this tool soon. The UI above is a front end to an NT 
service, also written in .NET, that takes jobs off of an MSMQ queue for batch 
dispatch. Because of the flexible architecture, these jobs can be spawned on a 
single machine or across multiple machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Best VS.NET Add-In: &lt;a href="mailto:iioffe@bezeqint.net">Igal Ioffe&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Igal wins a 
signed box copy of Visual Studio .NET for his VS.NET add-in:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Igal%20Ioffe%20screenshot.JPG" width="561" height="300">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Igal's submission is simple, but effective. I often mail snippets of code 
around and now I can do it with the context menu from without VS.NET.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Best Consumption of XML: &lt;a href="mailto:dejan@jelovic.com">Dejan Jelovic&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Dejan won his pick of a combination of things, but I couldn't talk him into 
taking anything -- he just wanted to compete. His application is a fully 
functional RSS reader:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Dejan%20screenshot.JPG" width="676" height="379">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dejan's RSS reader has two tabs, one for the RSS feed administration itself, 
persisted between sessions, and one for the combination of the content for all 
of your feeds in a single web page, cached between sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Best Use of SQL: &lt;a href="mailto:simon.wilson@objectnation.com">Simon E.P. Wilson&lt;/a>, Markus Burri &amp;amp; Thomas Schwarz&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Simon, Markus and Thomas win a 10-user copy of rmTrack for their SQL Stored 
Procedure code generator:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img border="0" src="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/SPInvoke.jpg" width="756" height="579">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the settings are chosen, the generated code lets the user make calls 
into the stored procedure from their .NET language of choice almost as if the 
function was a native .NET method:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>class MyApp {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        // Create Connection
        SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(@&amp;quot;...");
        conn.Open();      

&lt;b>        // Invoke the Stored Procedure
        SalesByCategory.Result res = SalesByCategory.Invoke(conn, "Beverages", "");
&lt;/b>
        // Show Results
        foreach (SalesByCategory.Row row in res.Rows) {
            Console.WriteLine("{0} : {1}", row.ProductName, row.TotalPurchase);
        }&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>        conn.Close();
    }
}&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2>Honorable Mention&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There were so many other great entries that I couldn't narrow it to just the 
big prize winners. The following were each awarded their pick of a book or a 
free software package:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Best Use of XML, &lt;a href="mailto:AdamCogan@ssw.com.au">Adam Cogan&lt;/a>&lt;/b>: This entry was cool because it used a 
  smart client to gather information about a user's system, email to deliver it 
  and XML to make server-side processing a snap (&lt;a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Adam%20Cogan%203%20screenshot.JPG" >screen 
  shot&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Best Web Service Client, &lt;a href="mailto:darrel@tavis.ca">Darrel Miller&lt;/a>&lt;/b>: I liked Darrel's 
  application because of the nice mix of a smart client front-end to capture all 
  settings to make a single, atomic web service call and the production of a web 
  site based on the  posted data (&lt;a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Darrel%20Miller%20screenshot.JPG">screen 
  shot 1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Darrel%20Miller%20screenshot%202.JPG">screen shot 2&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Best Technical Insight, &lt;a href="mailto:glombard@everdreamcorp.com">Gert Lombard&lt;/a>&lt;/b>: Gert's command line parser 
  was near and dear to me for two reasons. One, he'd built a command line parser 
  based on .NET's Reflection, &lt;a href="http://www.genghisgroup.com">just like 
  I've done&lt;/a> in Genghis with the CommandLineParser class, and two, he built it because he fell in love with Reflection, 
  just like I did (&lt;a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/Gert%20screen%20shot.JPG">screen shot&lt;/a>,
  &lt;a href="http://codeblast.com/~gert/dotnet/sells.html">source&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Best Game Library, &lt;a href="mailto:richard@caetano.com">Richard Caetano&lt;/a>&lt;/b>: Richard's entry wasn't quite 
  complete, but I love Poker as much as I love .NET, so I thought I'd point out 
  that he's provided a complete managed card drawing library, in case anyone 
  needs one (&lt;a href="http://www.stronglytyped.com/npoker/">screen 
  shot and source&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;b>Best Entry From High School Student, &lt;a href="mailto:rd933@msn.com">Ryan Dawson&lt;/a>&lt;/b>: I'm not sure I 
  should be encouraging such behavior, but I certainly spent my fair share alone 
  in my parent's basement with my computer and I turned out all right (didn't 
  I?!?), so I thought I'd mention that Ryan was the only high school student 
  (that I know of) that submitted an entry. Also, he used
  &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnforms/html/winforms08162002.asp">
  my pi calculator&lt;/a> to calculate 20K digits of pi for extra credit, so 
  clearly things are working out for him. Remember to cite your sources, Ryan! : 
  )&lt;/li>

        &lt;p>I learned how to write good emails at the foot of the master -- Don 
        Box. Whenever  we'd decide we wanted 
        something, he'd grab his computer and say, &amp;quot;Let's write the email&amp;quot; and 
        it would be done.&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>One of the most important things that I've ever 
        learned about high-tech communications is to never, ever write an email 
        in anger. Or, to be more precise, never *send* an email in anger. I 
        encourage you to actually write it. It always makes me feel better. But 
        don't address it, because you want that email to first end up in your 
        Drafts folder and go from there to your Deleted folder. If you address 
        it and mean to press Ctrl+S to Save but manage to press Alt+S to Send by 
        mistake, you might well be looking for work in another industry. If you 
        don't address it, however, Outlook complains and you can breathe a sigh 
        of relief. Frankly, I wish there was an add-in that protected me even if 
        I ignore my own advice:&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>&lt;img border="0" src="/public/spout/career.jpg" width="300" height="152">&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Of course, this spouting could only occurred after I've violated my 
        own advise, as I've often done over the years, always to my determent. 
        When you're angry, all you care about is making sure that your anger 
        comes through. If I give myself an hour or two to think on it, when I 
        come back to read that angry email, it always makes me flinch. Writing 
        an email once I'm done being angry always yields the nicest, most 
        thoughtful emails that I can write. Those I find to be *much* more 
        effective.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://cedar.intel.com/cgi-bin/ids.dll/content/content.jsp?cntKey=Generic+Editorial::net_bottleneck&amp;cntType=IDS_EDITORIAL&amp;catCode=CGX">Here&lt;/a>. Shawn Wildermuth and Chris Sells

"In the .NET Framework, rich clients can bring database servers to their knees, just like Web-based applications. But with the disconnected nature of ADO.NET, your rich clients can manipulate and analyze database data without impacting the database server. Once you have the data in the rich client, you can do high-performance analysis of the data—including sorting, filtering, and querying—without expensive server calls. In this article we will show you how to use DataSet, DataView, and XmlDataDocument to make your rich clients work with database data in a disconnected way."</content>

    <summary>Here. A year ago, thousands of people lost their lives at the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon. I'm working from home, so I can't put on my headlights, but I've been doing a lot of thinking about that day today and my "virtual" headlights are most definitely on. I'm sure today is very difficult for the survivors and I'd like to extend whatever comfort I can. May God bless you all.</summary>
