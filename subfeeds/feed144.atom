    <summary>Here. This is a pretty comprehensive, and pretty even-handed, comparison (Java gets kudos for doing some things better than C# and vice versa). If you're still curious about how the other half lives, check it out, but I'll bottom line it for you: C# and Java are pretty much the same language. The real differences are in the respective libraries, not the languages.</summary>
