Japan, it is said, the impersonal and sometimes unhelpful Microsoft error 

messages have been replaced with Japanese haiku poetry. Maybe in the next 

upgrade to our Windows... &lt;/p>&lt;p>Your file was so big. &lt;br>It might be very 

useful. &lt;br>But now it is gone. &lt;/p>&lt;p>The website you seek &lt;br>Cannot be 

located, but &lt;br>Countless more exist. &lt;/p>&lt;p>Chaos reigns within. 

&lt;br>Reflect, repent and reboot. &lt;br>Order shall return. &lt;/p>&lt;p>Aborted effort. 

&lt;br>Close all that you have worked on. &lt;br>You ask far too much. 

&lt;/p>&lt;p>Windows NT crashed. &lt;br>I am the Blue Screen of Death. &lt;br>No-one hears 

your screams. &lt;/p>&lt;p>Yesterday it worked. &lt;br>Today it is not working. 

&lt;br>Windows is like that. &lt;/p>&lt;p>Stay the patient course. &lt;br>Of little worth 

is your ire. &lt;br>The network is down. &lt;/p>&lt;p>A crash reduces &lt;br>Your 

expensive computer &lt;br>To a simple stone. &lt;/p>&lt;p>Three things are certain: 

&lt;br>Death, taxes and lost data. &lt;br>Guess which has occurred. &lt;/p>&lt;p>You step

I think they &lt;br>&amp;gt; are called VB programmers... ;) &lt;br>&lt;br>I hate to break this to you, but I've met a lot of VB programmers trapped in the body of a C++ programmer. Unfortunately, many development shops place a lot of peer pressure on people to reject their yearnings to stop using semicolons and memory allocators. It's sad, but VB programmers today are where US Blacks were in the 30's and gays were in the 50's. We have yet to see the "Rosa Parks" or "Stonewall Riots" for VB programmers. &lt;br>&lt;br>BTW, I have been preparing a keynote address in case I am ever asked to keynote a VB-friendly conference. If you want to look at a draft, &lt;b>go to &lt;a href="http://www.develop.com/dbox/dream.htm">http://www.develop.com/dbox/dream.htm&lt;/a> &lt;i>[ed: MLK's "I have a dream" set to VB music]&lt;/i>&lt;/b> &lt;/p>&lt;p>...I have been to VB7. I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you... &lt;br>&lt;br>DB &lt;/p>&lt;p>PS: Last time I checked, all programmers have selective ignorance. I know nothing about 3D graphics. I know a lot about COM. VB gets under people's skin because one can be ignorant of computer architecture and ASM and still &lt;br>get a lot done. &lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>&lt;i>&lt;b>Don Box&lt;/b> &lt;br>ATL Mailing List&lt;/i> &lt;/p></content>

    <summary>Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary, System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor, Longing for the warmth of bed sheets, Still I sat there, doing spreadsheets: Having reached the bottom line, I took a floppy from the drawer. Typing with a steady hand, I then invoked the SAVE command But got instead a reprimand: it read "Abort, Retry, Ignore." Was this some occult illusion? Some maniacal intrusion?

            Welcome to Attila
        &lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>
            Attila stands for &amp;quot;ATL for Applications.&amp;quot; Attila is a set of 
            extensions built on top of ATL to provide application-level services in the 
            same flavor as MFC. Towards that end, Attila uses a lot of the same notions as 
            ATL, e.g. heavy use of templates, static binding and reliance on the compiler 
            and the linker doing their job.&amp;nbsp; Also, in the flavor of ATL, Attila is 
            under-documented and requires a lot of user investment to make use of it. 
            However, once you do, we think you'll find the flexibility and efficiency worth 
            it. If you don't, you haven't lost much, 'cuz Attila is free. Enjoy.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;h1>
            Disclaimer
        &lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>
            Attila isn't a class library. Some of the headers depend on some of the others. 
            Some are stand-alone. You are free to pull in the pieces of Attila that you 
            need and leave the rest alone. Most of the headers were built by different 
            folks and while every effort was made to keep things consistent by choosing ATL 
            design techniques, everyone does things there own way.
        &lt;/p>

            Installation
        &lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>
            The current Attila bits are located at &lt;a href="/public/tools/attila/attila.zip">
            attila.zip&lt;/a>. Download and unzip them 
            into the folder of your choice (making sure to preserve path names). Make sure 
            to add the Attila include directory to your compilers include path. For 
            example, if you unzipped Attila into the &lt;b>c:\attila&lt;/b> directory, add &lt;b>c:\attila\include&lt;/b>
            to your compiler's include path. You can check to make sure you did this right 
            by building any of the samples in the &lt;b>samples&lt;/b> folder.
        &lt;/p>

            Support
        &lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>
            Please do not send Chris Sells or any of the other contributors personal email 
            complaining about Attila. Also please do not post Attila bug reports to any 
            other mailing list, e.g. DCOM or ATL. If you like, you can submit bugs to the 
            Attila Hit Squad mailing list (but only if you're a member). Nobody there is 
            under any responsibility to fix anything in Attila, but you might shame someone 
            into it. A much better way to contribute to the life of Attila is to submit the 
            fix along with the bug report. Or even better, join the Attila Hit Squad 
            mailing list and fix bugs submitted by others.
        &lt;/p>

            Who Did What
        &lt;/h1>
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Chris did a lot of the initial framework.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Justin did CMsgTranslator.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Ed did CRegPreferences and CRegWindowSerializer.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Curt did the common dialogs and restructured and added AX support to property 
                pages.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Matt and Shawn did work on the coolmenus and coolbars.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Simon did the multi-SDI stuff.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Joe did the command UI routing support.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Anthony did the command routing.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Rodrigo and Jim did the GDI wrappers.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Jorge did the Doc/View stuff.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Brad did the DDX/DDV support.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Shawn did CSimpleList.&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;h1>
            Documentation
        &lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>
            You might find some implementation notes for Attila in the &lt;b>docs&lt;/b> folder, 
            but you probably won't. If you have any documentation you'd like to submit, 
            we'd love to have it.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;h1>
            Samples
        &lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>
            Check the &lt;b>samples.htm&lt;/b> file in the &lt;b>samples&lt;/b> folder of the Attila 
            distribution. You can build all of the samples from the command line using the &lt;b>buildall.cmd&lt;/b>
            batch file in the &lt;b>samples&lt;/b> folder.
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;h2>
            CComSingleInstanceModule
        &lt;/h2>
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Uses Single_Instance_App as the DDE application name, preventing more than one 
                single instance ATL application from running at a time. DDE application name 
                should be based on something unique to the application, e.g. the module name.&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;h2>
            SdiDocView
        &lt;/h2>
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                No MRU.&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;h2>
            MdiDocView
        &lt;/h2>
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                None of the MDI accelerators work, e.g. ctrl-tab.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                There seems to be a lot of glue code in CMainWindow that could be hoisted to a 
                base class.&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                No MRU.&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;h2>
            LookOut
        &lt;/h2>
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Left pane needs work.&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
        &lt;h1>
            History
        &lt;/h1>
        &lt;ul>
