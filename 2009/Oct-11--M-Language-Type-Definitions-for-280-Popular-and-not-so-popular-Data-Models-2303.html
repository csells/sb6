<h1>"M" Language Type Definitions for 280 Popular (and not so popular) Data Models</h1>
Holy "M" types, Batman! Somebody's been busy building M type definitions for tons of existing data models, including ATOM, AWK, BPEL, C/C++/C#/Java, COBOL, HTML, LaTeX, Make and <A href="http://www.emn.fr/z-info/atlanmod/index.php/MsOsloM">the list goes on and on</A>. I don't know how they did it -- it's an amazing task! Now that they've got some free time back, maybe they'll build M language definitions to parse the file formats. I'm just sayin'... : )
