<h1>Longhorn Articles in Italian</h1>
<A href="http://www.devleap.com">Devleap.com</A>, a site dedicated to Windows development for Italian developers, has added <A href="http://www.devleap.com/Default.aspx?IdCategoria=LONGHORN">a new Longhorn section</A>. Even though I can't read Italian, I like the idea of Longhorn articles in a language of romance. Read them with your sweetheart over a candle lit dinner. I know that's my plan. : )
