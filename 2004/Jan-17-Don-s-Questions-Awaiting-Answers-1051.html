<h1>Don's Questions Awaiting Answers</h1>
<P>For those asking, I have sent off a selection of <A href="/1016">our questions to Don</A>. Eating dinner with him last night, he said that the first three answers were "yes," "no" and "100." When he gets all the answers together, I'll post them here. : )</P>
