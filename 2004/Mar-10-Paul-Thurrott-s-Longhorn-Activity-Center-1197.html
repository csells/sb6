<h1>Paul Thurrott's Longhorn Activity Center</h1>
<P>Paul Thurrott is more of a user guy then a developer guy, but you have to be a user before you can be a developer, and his stuff is often interesting. Now he's created a spot on his site to gather <A href="http://www.winsupersite.com/longhorn/">his Longhorn content</A>. My only question: where's the dang RSS feed?!?</P>
