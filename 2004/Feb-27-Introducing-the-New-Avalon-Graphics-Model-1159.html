<h1>Introducing the New Avalon Graphics Model</h1>
Ian Griffiths has a very nice piece about <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/avalongraphics.asp">the new drawing model in Avalon</A> and how it differs from the drawing model that's we've known and loved since 16-bit Windows. It also includes such tidbits as a reference for the currently under-documented Path.Data attribute. Highly recommended.
