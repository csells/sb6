<h1>OSS Groups Teaming Up to Combat Longhorn</h1>
It's interesting to hear <A href="http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-5201325.html?tag=nefd.lede">what the Mozilla and Gnome guys are thinking about to rally their forces to combat Longhorn</A>. The interesting thing about it for me, a developer and user of software, is that when MS products improve, competitors feel the need to keep up and vice versa. In other words, I think competition is a big win for everyone and I, for one, am glad we have it.
