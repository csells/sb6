<h1>Registration Open for WinHEC</h1>
If you need a look at Longhorn, but you couldn't make the PDC (or you're just dying for *another* look at Longhorn), <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winhec/default.mspx">WinHEC in May is the place to be</A>. Of course, it's also the place to be if you're a PC h/w vendor, but then, you guys already know that. : )
