<h1>Logging Indigo Messages</h1>
Roman Kiss has built <A href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/ConsoleIndigoLogging.asp">a little Indigo logging tool</A> that uses Indigo's ability to drop arbitrary code into the message pipline. Very handy for seeing what's really going on at the message level w/o changing any of your code. Personally, I'd like to see an Avalon version (or even a Windows Forms version) just 'cuz I think it'd be prettier. : )
