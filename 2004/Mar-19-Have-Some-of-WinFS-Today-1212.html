<h1>Have Some of WinFS Today</h1>
<A href="http://www.x1.com/">I have absolutely fallen in love with&nbsp;X1.</A> I don't search my email, attachments&nbsp;or file system anymore; I just type a few character into filter fields until the results have narrowed enough to show me what I was looking for. This is but a small part of what WinFS is going to enabled and it already saves me hours/month. Highly recommended.
