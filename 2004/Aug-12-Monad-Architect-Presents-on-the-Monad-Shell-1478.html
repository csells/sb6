<h1>Monad Architect Presents on the Monad Shell</h1>
Only4Gurus.com has posted a presentation by Jeffrey P. Snover, a Monad Architect, entitled "<a href='http://www.only4gurus.com/v2/preview.asp?ID=6307'>Monad Shell &#8211; Task-Oriented Automation Framework</a>," in which he covers the Monad mission, the overall architecture and key developer and admin concepts. I'm a huge Monad fan and so should you be.
