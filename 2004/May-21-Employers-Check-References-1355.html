<h1>Employers Check References</h1>
I got an email asking to serve as a reference for a guy I'd never heard of today. Just so you know, especially in a down economy, employers check references. Also, it's a good idea to <EM>ask</EM> a reference between adding them to your resume so they don't have to respond, "Roy? I don't know anyone named Roy..." : )
