<h1>Monkeying For Rory at PADNUG</h1>
Rory has graciously allowed me to volunteer as his code/slide monkey at <A href="http://www.padnug.org/padnug/meetings.aspx?ID=86">his Portland Area .NET User's Group meeting talk on Thursday, 2/26 at 6:30pm</A>. The topic, in his words: "2/3 'Stuff you can use right now' and 1/3 'When pigs fly (Longhorn)'." I miss monkeying with my DM brethren, so I'm looking forward to this very much.
