<h1>Windows Forms 2.0 Rocks The House</h1>
<A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=21658">Joe Stegman shows off the ability of Windows Forms 2.0 to build very professional looking UIs</A>, including clones of MSN Messenger, MS Money, IE and Outlook, all using out of the box controls. In particular, IE was implemented with 10 lines of non-Designer code. Whoa. I can only assume that the Windows Forms team will ship these code samples on <A href="http://www.windowsforms.net/">windowsforms.net</A>&nbsp;ASAP. Recommended.
