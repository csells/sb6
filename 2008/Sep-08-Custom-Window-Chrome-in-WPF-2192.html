<h1>Custom Window Chrome in WPF</h1>
Joe Castro, a developer on the WPF product team, has written a very cool article about <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wpfsdk/archive/2008/09/08/custom-window-chrome-in-wpf.aspx">how to do custom chrome in your WPF applications</A>. But, what makes it even cooler is that he dissects the various ways that shipping apps do custom chrome on various versions of Windows. It's amazing the number of techniques there are. Very nicely done, Joe.
