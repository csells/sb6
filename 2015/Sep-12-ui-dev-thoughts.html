<p>Hey Chris, if you're feeling happy enough to blog, how about a post giving
us your current thoughts on UI development. A friend of mine has asked me
for advice on moving an in-house app from VB6 to something he can find
people to modify if he needs to, and I can't for the life of me think of
what to tell him. I have your most excellent books on Windows Forms and WPF,
but what would the modern (!) equivalent be. Not WebJS, surely.</p>

<p>Thanks for the softball question, Winston. I do love to pontificate
extemporaneously (although I have already given away the ending).</p>
<h1>Pre-Windows</h1>
<p>I started my Windows career as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Windows-3-1-Charles-Petzold/dp/1556153953">Petzoldian Windows
developer</a>,
but before that, I developed UIs in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)">curses</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavors_(programming_language)">Flavors
Lisp</a> and even
voice-based UIs in a proprietary AT&amp;T scripting language for which I no longer
remember the name.</p>
<h1>Windows</h1>
<p>As a Windows developer, I programmed against 16 and 32-bit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface">GDI</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_USER">User</a>,
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms533798.aspx">GDI+</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library">MFC</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Template_Library">WTL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms">Windows
Forms</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a>,
<a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/winjs">WinJS</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">Silverlight</a> and
<a href="http://xamarin.com/forms">Xamarin Forms</a>. I've even written <a href="/writing">books, articles
and presentations</a> about many of these toolkits.</p>
<p>And even now, as I type this, I'm using a different framework,
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, to produce the UI
you’re using now.</p>
<h1>Transcend Windows</h1>
<p>It's this last fact that leads me to my pretty much universal recommendation for
UI development: The UI framework with the most reach, the best tools, the most
community support and the best staying power is, of course, HTML, with it's
kissing cousins, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
<p>There are good reasons to choose others, of course:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are you building a <strong>desktop game</strong>? Use <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">DirectX</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you building a <strong>mobile game</strong>? Use the iOS or Android APIs or, even
better, <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do you love C# and .NET</strong>? Then some implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Application_Markup_Language">XAML</a>
may suit your needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you targeting developers with <strong>automation</strong> or specific integration
needs? Then a command line interface is probably what you want.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But other than that, <strong>my default UI development advice is always always HTML</strong>.</p>
<h1>HTML How</h1>
<p>The beauty of an HTML-based UI framework is that it has grown steadily in
capability, usage and ubiquity since it was introduced in 1993. It's hard to
find an environment where HTML doesn't run:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>**Desktop Browser: **This is where HTML was first shown and it arguably
shows best here. There's little you can't do in this environment, including
near native games using <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/03/12/mozilla-and-epic-preview-unreal-engine-4-running-in-firefox/">WebGL, Enscripten and
asm.js</a>
(soon to become
<a href="https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/">WebAssembly</a>).</p>
<p>This is probably your best bet for any kind of internal app, e.g. the kind
of thing that VB6 and WinForms are usually used for. Toolkits like
<a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> and
<a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> are popular for desktop browser
apps because they provide the end-to-end developer story while still having
rich extension libraries.</p>
<p>That said, if I were going to tackle a new web site or web app today, I’d
probably use <a href="http://webcomponents.org/">WebComponents</a> (and
<a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a>) for the excellent reasons
that Joe Gregorio lays out in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMWAHzXQnNM">his OSCON 2015
talk</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Mobile Browser: **Today’s smartphone-based browsers are very capable and
adapt to desktop-based web sites fairly well. However, I do recommend making
sure your desktop web sites work well on mobile as well, if for no other
reason than you want to make sure you don’t lose your ranking on Google,
which now prefers mobile-friendly sites for mobile search results (and
provides <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/">a tool to help you get your site
ready</a>).</p>
<p>With the modern enterprise moving towards mobile as fast now as they have
been moving towards the web-based intranet over the last decade, I’d
recommend making sure that your internal web sites/apps work well on mobile
if you want to avoid the CTO stopping by your desk in the near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Desktop Stand-alone App: **The new trend (with companies like
<a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft</a> on board) for building
cross-platform, stand-alone desktop apps is to use HTML, but package it into
an app, specifically using something like
<a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>. This is the new hotness, but this is
what I’d do if I wanted to build a stand-alone desktop app today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Mobile Store App: **Most mobile apps today are built for the iOS and
Google Play stores, although increasingly enterprises are building mobile
apps for internal use and distributing them internally using private stores
like <a href="https://www.appaloosa-store.com/">Appaloosa</a>.</p>
<p>Today, mobile apps are built overwelminging using the platform-specific
native APIs, most often with two separate teams for each app, one for iOS
and one for Android. However, as mobile becomes more of an enterprise
platform, you want apps that are developed quickly, can be maintained easily
and can be built with a smaller number of developers, which all boils down
to one thing: you want to have a single codebase for your internal mobile
apps instead of one codebase per platform.</p>
<p>Today, you have two viable alternatives when building mobile apps that
target multiple platforms from a single source code base:
<a href="https://xamarin.com/platform">Xamarin</a> and <a href="http://phonegap.com/">Adobe
PhoneGap</a>. Xamarin is essentially cross-platform
.NET with some UI controls and native compilation thrown in, whereas
PhoneGap is a framework for hosting HTML on mobile platforms (as well as
others, but no one does that) along with a platform-agnostic JavaScript API
that maps to native functionality.</p>
<p>I've used both of these frameworks and they both have their pros and cons.
Xamarin has a simple UI framework that changes it’s look ’n’ feel depending
on the platform your app is running on, but PhoneGap does not. In that case,
I’d also bring <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> into the mix, which
will let you write your app in HTML but give you the native UI as
appropriate (and a beautiful one at that).</p>
<p>There has been much said about whether HTML is appropriate for building
mobile apps and while it’s possible to build <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-rebuilding-facebook-for-ios/10151036091753920">a bad
app</a>
using any platform, in my experience, it’s not hard to get <a href="https://www.sencha.com/blog/the-making-of-fastbook-an-html5-love-story/">an app that’s
built in HTML to look ’n’ feel just like a native
app</a>.
When I did it, there were some tricks involved, but frameworks like Ionic
pretty much take away the need for that these days. Of course there are
always going to be apps that can’t be built this way, but as a percentage
(leaving out twitch games), that number is getting smaller and smaller.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Where are we?</h1>
<p>Of course, the best and worst part of the web platform is that the community
changes it’s mind about how sites and apps should be built for the web platform
about as often as I change my underwear, so the specific recommendations are
merely appropriate for this point in time. The general guidance remains the
same, however: <strong>choose HTML for your UI development</strong> unless you’ve got a darn
good reason not to.</p>
