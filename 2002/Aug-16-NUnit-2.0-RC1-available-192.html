<h1>NUnit 2.0 RC1 available</h1>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10749&release_id=105544">Here</a>. From Bernard Vander Beken: Highlights of the updated unit testing framework for .NET:
- Attribute based mechanism for identifying test fixtures and test methods.
- Automatic creation of test suites.
- Improved GUI runner allowing dynamic reloading of test assemblies.
- The Console runner supports XML output.
- Mostly backward compatible with NUnit 1.0.
