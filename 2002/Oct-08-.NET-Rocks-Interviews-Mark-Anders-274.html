<h1>.NET Rocks Interviews Mark Anders</h1>
<a href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks.asp">Here</a>. "Carl and Mark talk with Mark Anders about ASP.NET, Framework v1.1, Languages, IIS 6.0, and other great topics. This week we had some celebrity callers: Developmentor's Chris Sells and MSDN Regional Director Stephen Forte ring the show, making for some great tech talk."

I couldn't resist calling Mark and giving him a hard time. : )
