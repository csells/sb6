<h1>.NET Refactoring Tool Enters Beta</h1>
<a href="http://www.xtreme-simplicity.net/index.cfm?PageID=3">Here</a>. "C# Refactory is a revolutionary new tool which enhances Microsoft's Visual Studio.NET IDE. It performs a number of complex refactorings automatically, allowing you to shape and re-shape your code as needs arise. It also helps you identify code which needs attention by calculating metrics, from 'lines of code' all the way up to 'cyclomatic complexity'. It is fully integrated with the IDE - no external tools means that refactorings are always ready at your fingertips."

As I'm writing a bunch of book code just now, I'm not a good beta tester for this tool, but the descriptions of what it does look yummy. I would especially love Extract Method and Rename Type.
