<h1>"Spend A Day With .NET" Tomorrow!</h1>
<a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet">Here</a>. I've heard from folks from all over the world that are using tomorrow as an opportunity to either dive into .NET for the first time or to build their pet project with .NET. People are splitting into teams, designing their entries and looking for 3rd party libraries to get them started, all without writing a single line of code until the stroke of midnight on the morning of August 30th in their local time zone. The competition is fierce, and while the prizes seem to have attracted people’s attention, I think it’s the competition that is getting folks excited. Should be fun! : )
