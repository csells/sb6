<a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet">Here</a>. Thanks for the submissions, folks! People reported exhaustion after spending 24 hours rushing to finish their entries, but uniformly thanked me for having them do it (and thus the power of .NET is revealed : ).

The judges are judging and I will the results as soon as I have them.
