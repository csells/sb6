<h1>There's a Windows "Brat Pack?!?"</h1>
<P>Not only does Amazon.com have <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006GM0G/">a traffic ranking for sellsbrothers.com</A>&nbsp;(80,616 -- this number sounds too high to be good : ), but there's a web site review claiming that I'm one of the "Windows Brat Pack." I have to associate with Anthony Michael Hall or Rob Lowe from <A href="http://www.thebratpacksite.com/">this bunch</A>&nbsp;(they seem the most geeky), but them who's Don and who's Tim? Definitely, Ted Pattison is Judd Nelson...</P>
