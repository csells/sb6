<h1>Amazon Unbox -- what about my TV?</h1>
<P>I don't want to download movies via <A href="http://www.vongo.com/">Vongo</A> or <A href="http://www.amazon.com/unbox">Amazon Unbox</A> to my PC; I want to download them to my TV and smart phone! <A href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</A> works because the videos are short, so watching them on my PV happens right now or not at all. Any movie or TV show service that doesn't let me play the result on my media center or take it with me on my phone, I just don't care. Does anyone want to watch 30+ minutes of video sitting at their desk or staring at their lap? I don't get it...</P>
