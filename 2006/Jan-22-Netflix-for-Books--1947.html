<h1>Netflix for Books?</h1>
I know, I know, "<A href="/1944">I hate books</A>." Still, books are where most of the content I love is, so I live with 'em. However, it'd be nicer if there were a Netflix for books, like there is for <A href="http://netflix.com">DVDs</A> and <A href="http://gamefly.com">games</A>. I think the public library should be become such a thing and I'd happily pay $15/month for mail delivery and return.
