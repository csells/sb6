<h1>Distributed .NET Newsletter</h1>
<a href="http://www.ingorammer.com/contact/newsletter.aspx">Here</a>. From Ingo Rammer: Starting with February 2003, I will publish a free, bi-weekly newsletter on distributed programming with .NET which covers architecture, design and development guides and tips as well as links to other free material I consider as "must reads".
