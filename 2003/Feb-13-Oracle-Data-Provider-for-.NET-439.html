<h1>Oracle Data Provider for .NET</h1>
<a href="http://otn.oracle.com/tech/windows/odpnet/content.html">Here</a>. From Mihies: The Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET) features optimized data access to the Oracle database from a .NET environment. Unlike OLE DB .NET and ODBC .NET, ODP.NET is a native driver and does not use a data access bridge, which can reduce performance. ODP.NET allows developers to take advantage of advanced Oracle database functionality. The data provider can be used from any .NET language, including C# and Visual Basic .NET.
