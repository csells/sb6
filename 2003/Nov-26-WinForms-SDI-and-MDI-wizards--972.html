<h1>WinForms SDI and MDI wizards?</h1>
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/sdimdiwizards.asp">Here</a>. I noticed that Stephane Rodriguez put an SDI and MDI wizard up on CodeProject. I've been *dying* for those forever, but I couldn't get his to work. Anyone come up with a simplified set up for them? Anyone interested in porting them to Genghis?
