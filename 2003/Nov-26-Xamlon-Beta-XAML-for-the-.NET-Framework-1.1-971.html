<h1>Xamlon Beta: XAML for the .NET Framework 1.1</h1>
<a href="http://www.xamlon.com/">Here</a>. XAML is the Longhorn mark-up language for declaring object types and instances and hooking them up to code. While it's most often used for declarative Avalon UI, it's useful for more than that. In fact, one enterprising 3rd party has just released a beta tool that provides a XAML subset for .NET 1.1. It's not quite the same, but interesting never the less.
