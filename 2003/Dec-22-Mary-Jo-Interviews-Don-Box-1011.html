<h1>Mary Jo Interviews Don Box</h1>
<a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,4248,1418556,00.asp">Here</a>. <P>Mary Jo Foley interviews Don Box on the origins of Indigo, the status of SOAP, the definition of SOA and Miguel de Icaza. Unfortunately, Mary Jo doesn't dig for any dirt and Don doesn't volunteer any, so it's a relatively boring interview. Luckily, it's short.</P>
