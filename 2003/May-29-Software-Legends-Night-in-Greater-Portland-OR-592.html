<h1>Software Legends Night in Greater Portland, OR</h1>
<a href="http://www.softwarelegends.com/events.html">Here</a>. David Chappell & I will be answering questions at the Borders on Cedar Hills Blvd in Beaverton, OR tonight. Things start at 7pm.

As an added treat, my parents are in town for my wife's nursing school graduation and they'll be at Borders wondering what the hell people are all worked up about. : )
