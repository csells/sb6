<h1>ASP Alliance reviews WinForms Programming in C#</h1>
<a href="http://www.aspalliance.com/articleViewer.aspx?aId=214">Here</a>. I don't know why an ASP site is reviewing a WinForms book, but they do a thorough job and, of course, I like their conclusion:

"If you are looking for a Windows Forms book, donâ€™t let this one slip out of your hands. The book has such insight and experience included that every reader, beginner and professional, will get benefit from reading it."
