<h1>Media2Go Preview</h1>
<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/media2go_preview.asp">Here</a>. The idea of Media2Go is a PDA/MP3-player-style device just for A/V, e.g. a video-enabled iPod. I have mixed feelings about it. I think I'd rather watch videos on my laptop and get an audio-enabled cell phone than carry yet another device.
