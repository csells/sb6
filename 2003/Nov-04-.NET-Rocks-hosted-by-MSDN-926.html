<h1>.NET Rocks! hosted by MSDN</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/dotnetrocks/">Here</a>. Because of increasing popularity, Carl Franklin asked the community for some help mirroring the audio from his .NET Rocks! internet talk show. MSDN has answered the call and is now mirroring the audio for each of the past .NET Rocks! shows and will be mirroring it into the future.

Enjoy (I know I do).
