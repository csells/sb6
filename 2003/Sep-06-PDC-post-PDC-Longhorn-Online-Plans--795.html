<h1>PDC/post-PDC Longhorn Online Plans?</h1>
<a href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com">Here</a>. Does anyone have any PDC or post-PDC plans for books, articles, conference talks, user groups, web sites, blogs, etc. on the topic of Longhorn? If so, please email me (csells@microsoft.com) so that I can compose a list for the MSDN Longhorn Developer's Center web site. Thanks!
