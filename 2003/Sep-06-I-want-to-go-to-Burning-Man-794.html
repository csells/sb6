<h1>I want to go to Burning Man</h1>
<a href="http://www.burningman.com">Here</a>. Oh, sure. I'd read about Burning Man in Wired like all geeks, but until John sent around an amazing email describing what he did this year and Josephine regailed me with her stories, I had no idea. It sounds life changing and I do like that! Anyone gone before? How do you prepare?
