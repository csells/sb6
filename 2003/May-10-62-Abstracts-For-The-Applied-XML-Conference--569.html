<h1>62 Abstracts For The Applied XML Conference!</h1>
<a href="/conference">Here</a>. Holy cow! I was *swamped* with abstracts for the Applied XML Developer's Conference. I got 62 and so many of them are so wonderful that I'm seriously considering expanding the Developer's Conference to 3 days (although I don't know if folks can stand that kind of density for that long : ).
