<h1>XmlSerializer Workshop </h1>
<a href="http://www.untidy.net/xsw/">Here</a>. Simon Steele has posted a most excellent tool for digging through an assembly of .NET types trying to build XML serializers for them. This helps you to figure out which classes are going to succeed at design-time instead of at run-time and shows you what's wrong. Much cooler than my silly command line app. Thanks, Simon!
