<h1>Registration-less COM to .NET Wrapper Tool Beta</h1>
<a href="http://www.aurigma.com/Products/COMtoNET/">Here</a>. Aurigma has posted the beta for a COM to .NET wrapper generation tool that doesn't require the COM server to be registered, which is nice for hosted scenarios. It also generates the wrapper code for you to see and edit for your own purposes. Interesting.
