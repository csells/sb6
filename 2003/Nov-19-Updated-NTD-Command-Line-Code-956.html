<h1>Updated NTD Command Line Code</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnforms/html/winforms05152003.asp">Here</a>. Some folks have had trouble with ieexec.exe throwing a System.IO.FileLoadException when using my No-Touch Deployment command line handling code for .NET 1.0 and 1.1. Andrew Duncan burned a PSS call to figure out the problem and I've updated the sample code to match (ieexec.exe needs a Last-Modified header). Thanks, Andrew!
