<h1>nprof - Open-source .NET profiler</h1>
From Matthew Mastracci: I just released the third alpha version of my open-source .NET profiling application.  It supports everything I've thrown at it so far (multi-threaded programs, NAnt, SWF apps) and is getting close to feature-complete.

It comes with a basic VS.NET add-in that lets you profile from DevStudio.  There is a source package on the downloads page for those who are interested in tinkering.

Download it at http://nprof.sourceforge.net
